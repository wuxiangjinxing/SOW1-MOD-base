Legends 1A: Promise of Peace,传说 第1章上：和平承诺
As expected. Lord Godfrey was never going to let this happen peacefully.,正如预料的那样。戈弗雷勋爵从未打算和平解决此事。
"I must reach the capital, here. Be on guard, we can surely expect even more resistance than what we see now.\! Pray we do not face his elite Arbalest units again, they have proven quite deadly.","我必须要到达首都。保持警惕，我们肯定会面对比现在还要强烈的抵抗。\!千万不要再让我们遇到他的精锐钢弩部队，事实证明，它们极其危险。"
"Florina, I dread the idea of bringing a child to this battlefield. But you must know that these men are coming for you.\! You must stay near me, but stay safe. Just until we make it to Armitage in one piece.","芙洛里娜，把一个孩子带上战场令我揣揣不安。不过你要知道，这些人都是来害你的。\!不要离我太远，注意安全。等我们完完整整地到达阿米塔吉再说。"
"I will stay near! I trust you, Captain Antares!",我会的！我相信你，安塔瑞斯队长。
Thank you. Donar watch over us.,谢谢。多纳尔保佑我们。
"How absurd! This is the great hope for all Veridia? This small child?!\! What has she done to earn Donar's favor? What could she do?!\! Captain Antares, a true lapdog, to the very end. Arbalests, destroy him!",太荒谬了！这就是全维尔迪亚的希望？一个小娃娃？！\!她做过什么可以得到多纳尔青睐的事？她又能做什么呢？！\!安塔瑞斯队长直到最后也不过是条走狗。钢弩部队，击溃他吧！
