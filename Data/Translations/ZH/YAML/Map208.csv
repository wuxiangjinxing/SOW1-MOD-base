"Stay here, \n[8].\! I will deal with the grandmaster myself.",待在这儿，\n[8]。\!我会亲自对付圣宗。
Come on...\| I know who you are...\| why are you doing all this?!\! I'm not going to just let you go in alone...,别这样……\|我知道你是谁……\|你为什么要做这一切？！\!我不会让你一个人进去的……
"His power comes from a source outside of what you can comprehend.\! You must leave this to me.\! You would surely die.\! ...\| Don't let that happen, \n[8].",他的力量来自你无法理解的地方。\!你必须让我一个人处理。\!你肯定会死的。\!……\|千万不要死啊，\n[8]。
"You've spared the Nephilim.\! This is very disappointing, Hand of Zanatus.\! We were nearly there... so close to ending our struggle.\! I feel utterly betrayed!",你放过了圣灵。\!我很失望，扎纳图斯之手。\!我们本来快成功了……很快就可以结束我们的斗争了。\!可我却被彻底背叛了！
"There's no need for pretense anymore.\! I learned all I need to know.\! All of your knowledge of the past...\| it is because you were there.\! You've been here since Donar first defeated you in battle.\! Now, you've amassed incredible influence. But that's not enough, is it?\! What do you want?",不用再伪装了。\!我已经知道了我需要知道的一切。\!你那广博的历史知识……\|是因为你亲身经历过。\!多纳尔第一次在战斗中击败你后，你就一直在这里。\!现在，你已经积累了巨大的影响力。但这还不够，不是吗？\!你到底想要什么？
"...\|Indeed, it seems we've exceeded the need for pretense, and I have created something I can no longer control.",……\|没错，看来我们不需要伪装了，而且我还创造了一个我再也无法控制的东西。
"If you must know, after that battle with Donar, I was forced to remain feeble, hiding, taking full advantage of the pity and mercy of the victors.\! But gradually, my people found our way into the Donari halls of power, that we may finally emerge from the shadows.\! And now, we are fully self-determined, no one will humiliate us again!\! We've enlightened great masses of Donari, and cured them of their misguided loyalty to the false gods.\! You, and the Avatar of Donar, and that imbecile Casamir... all fight within the confines of a human lifetime. Petty concerns, these empires and alliances.\! The greatest struggle of this world is mine... to liberate all of Tahnra from the stranglehold of Donar, the greatest deceiver in all creation.\! Great warrior, it is not about what I want. It is about what should be!",如果你一定要知道的话，与多纳尔的那场战斗结束后，我充分利用胜利者的怜悯，不得不隐藏力量躲起来。\!但渐渐地，我的手下渗透进了多纳尔信徒的权力中心，之后我们终于可以从阴影中走出来了。\!现在，我们完全自由了，没有人能再跟我们对着干了！\!我们已经启蒙了多纳尔的广大信众，让他们不再忠诚于伪神。\!无论是你，还是多纳尔的化身，还是那个废物卡萨米尔……都依靠人类有限的生命来战斗。这些帝国和联盟都是些琐事而已。\!这个世界上最伟大的斗争是由我在挑起……将整个塔恩拉从多纳尔、世界最大的欺骗者的束缚中解放出来。\!伟大的战士，这与我想要什么无关。而是与应该怎么做有关!
"...\| You know there's no way I can just sit here and wait, I've got to do something!",……\|你知道我不可能在后面干等的，我必须做点什么！
"I told you to stay back, \n[8]...",我告诉过你别过来，\n[8]……
"We meet again, Avatar of Donar!\! Or \n[8], or...\| however you identify these days.\! You do know that there is truly nothing special about you, I hope?\! Perhaps instead, in your limited understanding of things, you've assigned prophecies to that which you cannot explain.\! I suppose it is commendable that you, \n[8], have simply made yourself into a suitable replica for an ancient legend...\! you and your fellow Nephilim worthy hosts for the divine refugees that are the false gods.\! But, perhaps you know that already... ever the skeptic, this one.",我们又见面了，多纳尔的化身！\!或者\n[8]，或者……\|总之是当代人们对你的这些称呼。\!你应该知道你确实没有什么特别之处吧？\!也许相反，在你对事物的有限理解中，你将预言看做是无法解释的事物。\!值得称赞的是，\n[8]，你只是将自己变成了一个古代传奇的合适的复制品……\!你，还有你那些同样为已经沦为神圣难民的假神们提供合适宿主的圣灵同胞们。\!但是，也许你已经知道了……你这人，一直以来都是个怀疑论者。
"This is a shame, I admit.\! You Donari... this great human experiment, quite the centerpiece of Tahnra!\! A grand and ultimately brittle manifestation of Donar's meddling.\! No matter... in the new world, these silly identities and histories, Veridian, Sayunaari, what have you.\! There is no room for such delineations in this world's future.\! Those who try to cling to ignorance will simply... go extinct, I suppose!\! As for you, \n[8], I'm afraid your journey has come to an end.\! Rest assured, your death will be permanent this time, and will signal the greatest victory against Donar yet, and a harbinger for a new, enlightened age.",我承认这很遗憾。\!你们多纳尔信徒……这场宏大的人类实验，塔恩拉世界的核心！\!由于多纳尔的干预出现的，一项宏大但归根结底脆弱的产物。\!无所谓了……在新世界，这些愚蠢的身份和历史，无论是维尔迪亚人、萨育纳人，还是别的什么。\!这个世界的未来，不会有这些概念。\!我想那些试图坚持无知的人只会……灭亡！\!至于你，\n[8]，恐怕你的旅程已经结束了。\!请放心，这次你将永远死去，并将标志着对多纳尔战争取得的最大胜利，以及一个新的开明时代的开端。
Aaaagh....\| Being torn apart!!!,啊啊……\|要被撕碎了！！！
You crazy fool...\| some things never change...,你这个疯子……\|有些事情永远不会改变……

Guess I really shook him up.,我想我真的吓到他了。
How did you manage to hurt him that way?,你是怎么靠这招伤到他的？
Blood link...\| thought he could keep me in line with it...\| didn't think I'd really do it...\| did...,血咒链接……\|他以为可以用这来约束我……\|以为我不会真的这样做……\|不……
...Zelos??,……泽洛斯？？
