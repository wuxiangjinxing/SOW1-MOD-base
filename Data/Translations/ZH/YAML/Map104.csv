Hey Beatrix!\! How are you liking it here?,嘿，碧翠丝！\!你在这儿感觉怎么样？
"Oh, I guess I'm supposed to 'belong' now?",哦，我猜我现在理应要有“归属感”了？
So you're just gonna fly solo?\! Well I'm not gonna let that happen!,所以你是打算当独行侠？\!但我可不会让这种事发生！
Is that so?\! Good luck with that.\! But you do seem like a real sweetie.\! Perhaps I'll make you my most prized servant.,是嘛？\!那祝你好运吧。\!但你看上去确实是个真正的小可爱。\!或许我会让你成为我最珍爱的小跟班也说不定。
"Oh...\| Can I ask... how did you become so magically gifted?\! I've never seen your tricks, even from the most experienced battlemages.",噢……\|我能不能问下……你是怎么变得这么有魔法天赋的啊？\!我从来没见过你这样的技艺，我见过的最有经验的战斗法师都使不出。
"'Tis my gift and my curse, Jules.\! My existence is a bit of an experiment.\! Y'see, I'm the first Nephilim those cultists knew about, so they tried to twist me in every which way to get me to do their bidding.\! Really messed with my brain, they tell me.",这既是天赋也是诅咒，朱尔斯。\!我的存在是实验的产物。\!你瞧，我是那些邪教徒所得知的第一个圣灵，所以他们试着用各种方式扭曲我，让我听从他们的吩咐。\!听他们说我的脑子因此被搞得一团糟。
...Messed with your brain?,……把你脑子搞的一团糟？
"Don't you see?\! The elevator doesn't reach the top floor here!\! A few nuts and bolts missing!\! Who knows, I might just snap in the middle of this conversation and make you explode, just for fun!\! Whaddya think about that?!",你看不出来吗？\!假如把理智比作升降机，我这台是到不了顶楼的！\!少了几块零件呐！\!谁知道呢，我可能会在这场对话进行到一半时突然暴走然后让你瞬间爆炸，只是为了好玩！\!你感受如何啊？！
I don't think you'd do such a thing.,我可不觉得你会做这种事。
"Hahaha... if you say so.\! Hey, you're a gem, but I've gotta practice my skills and I need you to keep your distance!\! Do take care, hmm?",哈哈哈……如果你这么说的话。\!嘿，你是个好人，但我必须练习技术了，你可得离远点！\!务必多保重，嗯哼？
"Hmmm, alright sure.\! Have fun, Beatrix!",嗯……那当然。\!练习愉快，碧翠丝！
That I can do!,那还用说！
