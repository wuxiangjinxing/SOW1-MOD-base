"Welcome to Ezrum, Jules.",欢迎来到艾泽拉姆，朱尔斯。
"Yeah, wow! Narima... I have to admit, I didn't expect it to look like this.\! Everything looks kind of... new.\! The stories I've heard tell of ancient cities!",好哎，哇噢！娜瑞玛……我必须承认，我没想到它看起来会是这样。\!一切看起来都有点儿……新。\!我听到的故事里讲的可是古城！
"Your perception serves you well.\! For this city is, for all purposes, only a generation older than we are.\! Its former, glorious form, dated back thousands of years...\! but the Veridians saw fit to destroy that which they could not have, to wipe an icon of the past off the timeline of this world.\! Well-dressed barbarians, they are.",您的洞察力很敏锐。\!因为从各种角度看，这座城市都只比我们年长一代。\!它先前的、辉煌的形态，可以追溯到几千年前……\!但维尔迪亚人认为他们无法拥有的东西就该被摧毁，从这个世界的年表上抹去一个旧日的象征。\!他们是衣冠楚楚的野蛮人。
How did the Veridians cause so much destruction?,维尔迪亚人是怎么造成如此巨大的破坏的？
"The Aetherium Crisis. You may hear tales of this event from the Veridians -\! that a Sayunaari princess named Soha of Dargon... whose beauty defied description, whose magical gift grew out of control... that she became a terrible archvillain.\! From the Sayunaari perspective, the conflict was provoked entirely by the Veridians, who made use of a power they could not understand, and did not deserve to wield.\! In a great war between the Empire of Veridia and all the world's nations, Ezrum was utterly destroyed by a nightmarish weapon they developed in a bid to subdue us.\! Tens of thousands of our people perished in an instant.\! Of course, even then, we Sayunaari perservered to win that war.\! Ezrum was rebuilt some 50 years ago, when the Aetherium Crisis's curse finally subided.",以太危机。您可能从维尔迪亚人那里听到过相关的故事——\!萨育纳公主，达贡的索哈……她的美貌倾国倾城，魔法才能却日渐失控……最终变成了一个恐怖的大反派。\!从萨育纳人的角度来看，冲突完全是由维尔迪亚人挑起的，他们使用了一种他们无法理解、也不配使用的力量。\!在维尔迪亚帝国与整个世界的一场大战中，为了征服我们，他们制造了一台噩梦般的武器，彻底摧毁了艾泽拉姆。\!数以万计的人瞬间丧生。\!当然，即便如此，我们萨育纳人也坚持不懈地赢得了这场战争。\!艾泽拉姆重建于大约50年前，那时以太危机的诅咒终于平息了。
"Well that's an accomplishment, don't you think?",这是很了不起的成就啊，你不觉得吗？
"Jules, this is something you must understand well.\! Our people do not value the same things Veridians do.\! While Ezrum now stands greater than its former self in many ways, a vital part of our national spirit was lost... forever.\! Ezrum as it should be stands only in memories that, too, will fade away in time.",朱尔斯，这是你必须深入理解的事情。\!我们的人民和维尔迪亚人的价值观不同。\!虽然艾泽拉姆现在在许多方面都比以前更加伟大，但我们民族精神的一个重要部分已经消失了……永远消失了。\!艾泽拉姆所应有的样貌只存在于记忆之中，而它同样也会随着时间的流逝而消失。
"Thank you, Narima. It seems I have much to learn about my homeland...",谢谢你，娜瑞玛。看来我对我的祖国还有很多东西需要了解……
