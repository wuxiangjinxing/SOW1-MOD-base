"Stefan, a moment?",斯泰凡，有空吗？
"\n[8]! Of course! Although I warn you, I am nursing my 3rd glass of brandy, so I preemptively strike from the record any incriminating statements.\! What can I do for you, friend?",\n[8]！当然了！不过我先把话放在前头，我已经在享用第三杯白兰地，所以我说的任何能将我定罪的话都不算数。\!我能为你做些什么，朋友？
"You are working with the Temple as a spy, I understand?",你是个为圣殿工作的间谍，没理解错吧？
"Yep. Y'see, the blonde and I are in cahoots, as they say.",没错。你看，按照社会主流的说法，那个金发女郎和我是同伙。
You mean Diana.,你是说戴安娜。
"Yes! That's the one.\! Ya know, the one that's got a big ole' muscle where Donar usually puts a sense 'a humor.\! ...Ah what am I sayin', she's a big goofball if you let her relax a bit.\! Wanna get on her good side in a flash? Food. Even mentioning it makes her eyes sparkle with glee.",是啦！就是那家伙。\!你懂吧，连通常多纳尔在创造人类的时候会安置幽默感的地方，在她身上都全被肌肉取代了。\!……啊，我瞎说什么呢，其实如果你能让她松弛下来，那她就是个纯傻冒。\!想转瞬之间就赢得她的好感？吃的。哪怕只是提上一嘴都会让她的眼睛闪闪发光。
"Heh, noted. So, you're risking your life on the Temple's behalf, are you a devotee?",哈，记下了。所以，你把脑袋拴在裤腰带上给圣殿打工，你是信徒吗？
"Well... Let me bring ya back 2 or 3 years.\! Got tired of the junk peddlin', purse cuttin', y'know, small time stuff.\! Got involved with the Tidereavers. Real bad fellas.\! Let me tell you, bein' THAT much of an outlaw is the thrill of a lifetime.\! That is, until you get involved with... y'know. Their primary cargo. Slaves!",嗯……让我跟你从两三年前说起吧。\!我厌倦了倒买倒卖、划人腰包，你知道的，那类小场面。\!然后我就去了噬浪海贼团。那是群真的坏透了的家伙。\!我跟你讲，做一个法外狂徒真的是快乐似神仙呐。\!直到你参与到……你懂的。参与到他们的主营业务，贩奴！
Crazy...\| So what happened?,真疯狂……\|所以发生了什么？
"They were shippin' slaves to the fungus plantations of Greyden.\! A common source of income for those dogs.\! I, however, was able to help myself to the captain's jewel chest while they were dealin' with a ""policing action"" by the Veridians.\! Almost slipped away, but then... I saw her.\! That towering titaness of terror. She came out of the Imperial ships barrellin' around, smashin' those pirates like they were gnats.\! I tell ya, you would not believe it if ya didn't see it!",他们负责把奴隶运送到格雷登的真菌种植园。\!这群死狗常见的收入来源。\!而我，则趁他们应付一群维尔迪亚人的“巡查行动”的时候，找到了船长的珠宝箱。\!我差点儿就开溜啦，但就在那时……我看到了她。\!那个可怕的高塔一样的女巨人。她从帝国战舰上飞扑下来，那些海盗就像小虫子一样被碾得粉碎。\!我跟你讲，你不亲眼看到的话是肯定不信的！
So how did you end up crossing paths with her?,那你最后是怎么跟她走到一路去的？
"Well... y'see...\! She caught me! Hahaha!\! But, no worries, this slippery toad avoided jail, as usual.",啊……那是因为……\!我给她逮着啦！哈哈哈！\!但，安心吧，滑不溜手的小蟾蜍像往常一样逃过了牢狱之灾。
"Aha... snuck away, huh?",啊哈……偷溜了是吧？
"Yeah!\! Well...\| no.\! Y'see Diana and I made an agreement!\! She needed masters of espionage to investigate those cultists.\! So, I do some dirty work, and she keeps me nice and legal.\! Turns out, we're a hell of a team.\! Plus, I've found me new family in the Temple folks.\! Real bleedin' nice, I tell ya.",是呀！\!呃……\|并不。\!你看，戴安娜跟我达成了协议！\!她需要谍报方面的人才来调查那些邪教徒。\!所以，我做些脏活儿，她则确保我不会有犯罪记录。\!事实证明，我们这团队可真是天作之合呀。\!另外，我在圣殿的这帮家伙里找着了新的家。\!真特么棒极了，我跟你讲。
"That's quite a story.\! And now you're here, chasing prophecies with me.",可真是个精彩的好故事。\!现在你在这儿，和我一起追寻预言。
"It's gonna be one hell of a ride, friend!\! Hey, I think you're alright. I mean that.\! You got my back, I got yours.\! 'Specially if you can secure me another spot of brandy, eh, eh?",想想就觉得真特么痛快，朋友！\!嘿，我觉得你人不错。我认真的。\!咱们戮力同心，肝胆相照。\!要是你能再给我搞点儿白兰地就更棒了，嗯，嗯？
