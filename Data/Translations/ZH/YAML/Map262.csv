Legends 4A: Echoes,传奇4A：回声
"Well, well, Jebediah. It seems you've actually managed to become useful to me!\! Don't go thinking this means you're off my naughty list just yet, little man.",哎呀，耶比底亚。看来你还真勉强变得对我有点用了！\!但别以为这就意味着你从我的淘气名单上除名了，小家伙。
"B-b-begging your pardon, great sacrifices were made to find this place! The Grandmaster may be very upset with-",对、对不起，为了找到这个地方付出过巨大的牺牲！圣宗可能会非常生气——
"Shush, servant.",闭嘴，仆人。
"Yes, Miss Beatrix...",遵命，碧翠丝小姐……
"If you're just about done groveling for a tiny sliver of my approval, care to explain what's so special about this place?",如果你已经演完为了获得我一丝认可而卑躬屈膝的丑态的话，解释一下这个地方有什么特别之处吧？
"Why, this is a salvaged piece of the Arc Donarium. It contains technological wonders we no longer have the knowledge to create, only to try to maintain.\! I believe the missing pieces of the Historium Magnus can be found in the... um... archives here.\! Devices carried by high-ranking members of the Grandmaster's Dark Mages.\! There should be a Master Archive that will complete my chronicles and unleash the secrets of the petty Donari founders forever!",哎呀，这是一块被抢救回的大多纳尔残骸。它包含的技术奇迹我们已不能复现，只能勉力维护。\!我相信《伟大史书》遗失的部分可以在此处的……嗯……档案中找到。\!意即圣宗的高级黑暗法师所携带的设备。\!应该有一个主档案，可以让我完成编年史，并永远解开那些无足轻重的多纳尔教开创者们的秘密！
"Is that so? Well, do you know how to get through this place?",是这样吗？那么，你知道如何通过这个地方吗？
"I-I'm sorry, Miss Beatrix, that I do not know yet...",对、对不起，碧翠丝小姐，我还不知道……
"Pah, useless as ever! I suppose I'll have to be the brains for both of us, as usual.",哼，一如既往的没用！我想我还是要像往常一样做我们俩中有脑子的那个。
"It seems the teleporter devices we know and love today are alive and well here.\! Jeb, be a good worm and lead a group on the other side of this cute little maze they've set up for us.\! We will meet again when we've found this ""Master Archive"" you keep going on about.\! Can you manage this or must I speak more slowly for you?",看来我们今天熟知和喜爱的传送器设备在这里还很活跃。\!耶比，做个好虫子，带带一队人到他们为我们设置的这个可爱小迷宫的另一边去。\!等找到你一直唠叨的这个“主档案”之后我们再见吧。\!你能搞得定吗，还是说我得慢慢给你重复一遍？
"Yes, Miss Beatix, your brilliance shines ever more brightly! You can count on me!",遵命，碧翠丝小姐，您的光辉比以往更加耀眼！包在我身上！
\c[1]Helios Lab Report - 980.11.10\! Extraction failure. Subject in stable condition. We suspect that the quality of Aetherite was inadequate. Energy efficacy within subject was superficial at best.\! Advise the use of a sample with at least 99.1% efficiency. Subject to recover for 7 days before second attempt.,\c[1]赫利俄斯实验室报告——980.11.10\!提取失败。实验体状况稳定。我们怀疑以太石的质量不够好。实验体的能量效率充其量也只是无关痛痒。\!建议使用效率至少为99.1%的样品。实验体在第二次尝试前先恢复7天。
"My gracious. Helios Lab? Extraction, Aetherite...\| and, Subject?\! Pah, I refuse to play the guessing game. This is all nonsense to me thus far.",天呐。赫利俄斯实验室？提取、以太矿……\|还有实验体？\!呸，我不玩猜谜游戏。到目前为止，这些对我来说都是废话。
"\c[1]Helios Lab Report - 980.11.18\! Subject perished. Aetherite overload, energy dispersed. A complete disaster.\! We still have subjects with a higher blood concentration, but I will surely be punished for this setback.\! We will have to use multiple and smaller Aetherite clusters for future extractions. Perhaps these findings will redeem our research and my position.",\c[1]赫利俄斯实验室报告——980.11.18\!实验体死亡。以太元气过载，能量扩散了。一场彻底的灾难。\!我们还有血液浓度更高的实验体，但我肯定会因为这次失败受到惩罚。\!我们得用多个更小的以太石簇来进行之后的提取。也许这些发现能挽回我们的研究和我的职位。
"Hmph. Sounds like their little experiment didn't go so well this time. I hope this poor chap got what he deserved for his failure!\! Now, I've heard of vague terminology from the Aetherium Crisis that sounds a bit like this. Aetherium, Aetherial energy, extraction.\! Seems these Helios folks were bent on putting together the shattered pieces of the past to shape their future. Diabolocal, as one would expect.",哼。听起来他们的小实验这次不太顺利。我希望这不幸的家伙因为这次失败好好受顿罚！\!好了，我听说过从以太危机时期流传下来的模糊术语，和这些有点类似。以太，以太能量，提取。\!似乎这些赫利俄斯项目的人一心想把过去的碎片拼凑起来以塑造他们的未来。和我预想的一样，真够邪恶的。
"\c[1]Bioaetherial Research Log - 974.05.13\! Findings less than optimal. While all five archetypes have been successfully catalogued, only subjects with a significant concentration of Archetype C are currently available.\! I am happy to report that we have an abundance of suitable recipients for infusion.\! These potentials will be processed in asending order of energy efficacy and compatibility.",\c[1]生物以太研究日志——974.05.13\!发现不尽如人意。虽然所有五个原型都已成功编目，但目前只有拥有显著原型C浓度的实验体可用。\!我很高兴地报告，我们有大量适合的受体进行融注。\!这些潜能者将按照能量效率和兼容性从低到高排序进行处理。
"How fascinating! Such an efficient operation, as one would expect when tinkering with the power of creation.\! It seems the Grandmaster had the brilliant foresight and ancient wisdom to treat this process with the deliberate care it deserves. It is no wonder he will rule all of Tahnra.",多么迷人！如此高效的操作，正是人们期待中摆弄创造之力的人所应有的水准。\!看来圣宗有着高明的先见和古老的智慧，以应有的谨慎对待这一过程。难怪他将会成为整个塔恩拉的统治者。
"\c[1]Bioaetherial Research Log - 982.01.07\! Situation is critical, but salvageable. Subject 16(B), while far and away the candidate with the highest energy efficacy and compatibility, subject is 3 years older than the subjects of all previous infusion attempts.\! Aetherite research is complete, with a 99.991% chance of success, so we will proceed with infusion of Subject 16(B).",\c[1]生物以太研究日志——982.01.07\!情况危急，但可以挽救。实验体16（B），虽然远远不是能量效率和相容性最高的候选人，但其比之前所有被尝试融注的对象都要大3岁。\!以太石研究已经完成，成功几率为99.991%，因此我们将开始对实验体16（B）进行融注。
"Subject 16(B)...\| fascinating. It seems that everything has lead up to that day, during Year 982. I cannot wait to discover the results of this fateful experiement!",实验体16（B）…\|太神奇了。似乎一切都指向了那一天，也就是982年。我迫不及待地想知道这一决定性实验的结果了！
