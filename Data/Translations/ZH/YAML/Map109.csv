"Greetings, human.",你好，人类。
"First things first, please call me \n[8].\! Deal?",首先，请叫我\n[8]。\!好吗？
Yes \n[8]. Raskuja will comply.,好的，\n[8]。拉斯库亚听从命令。
"So, I've heard so much about this Eskandar, fella.\! Some sort of legendary Barek Tor.\! What's the deal with him anyway?\! You would think he was some sort of god.",所以说，我听过很多关于这个艾斯坎达的事，伙计。\!好像是兽人的传奇人物吧。\!具体是为什么呢？\!他被描绘的如同某种神祗一般。
"Eskandar was a fierrrrrce and powerful warrior 100 years ago, during time of great crisis.\! Humans sought to conquer Barek Tor and destroy Barek Tor spirit.\! The great Eskandar rrrrrallied people together and defeated much more powerful enemy to earn Barek Tor freedom.\! Eskandar so great, he left Barek Tor lands to seek out and to destroy this enemy where they hide.\! He return home loved by all.\! Eskandar becomes grrrrreat chieftain of all Barek Tor people, and repopulate our kind.\! Most Barek Tor somehow related to Eskandar this day... I hope so is Raskuja, so have his grrrrreat and divine warrior blood.",艾斯坎达是100年前大危机时期的战士，超~~~勇猛善战。\!人类试图征服兽人并摧毁兽人的精神。\!伟大的艾斯坎达振~~~臂高呼，团结大家以弱胜强，给兽人带来了自由。\!艾斯坎达如此伟大，为了前往敌人的藏身之处并击垮他们，他离开了兽人的土地。\!他归来时受到了所有人的敬爱。\!艾斯坎达成为了所有兽人子民的的大~~~酋长，也重振了我之一族。\!如今大部分兽人多少都跟艾斯坎达有些关系……拉斯库亚希望自己也是这样，这样我就也流淌着他的伟~~~大而神圣的战士之血。
I wonder why I'd never learned much about him.,我很好奇为什么我从没听过这些。
"Barek Tor lifespan not as long as human.\! Eskandar pass to next life after rrrrreaching golden age of 50 years.\! Eskandar policy on human is to be being frrrrriendly, because of best friend named ""Lucian Iblis"" who was prominent human and great hero of human lands.",兽人寿命不比人类。\!艾斯坎达在达~~~到50岁的黄金年龄后就往生啦。\!艾斯坎达对人类的政策是友~~~好的，因为他和名叫“卢西恩·艾比斯”的重要人类、人类土地上的伟大英雄，是好朋友。
"Yep, everyone knows about Lucian Iblis.",是的，我们都知道卢西恩·艾比斯。
"Because of their frrrrriendship, human and Barek Tor were to be connected.\! Lucian live on many years past Eskandar, but without our great hero, Lucian and Barek Tor people were to being disconnected slowly over time.\! Lucian attempt to befrrrrriend new Barek Tor chieftains, but it was not to be being.\! Over next 50 years, Barek Tor attempt to return to old way.\! No longer trrrrrade food with humans of Sayunaa in exchange for their great trrrrreasures.\! Barek Tor society become poor.\! Now we attempt to repair damage but without being weak to conquest much like during the time of Eskandar.",由于他们的友~~~谊，人类和兽人连结了起来。\!卢西恩在艾斯坎达离世后活了很多年，但没有了我族的伟大英雄，卢西恩和兽人的关系日渐疏远。\!卢西恩尝试过成为新兽人大酋长的好~~~朋友，但事与愿违。\!在之后的50年里，兽人回到了老路上。\!再也不和萨育纳的人类进行贸~~~易，用食物来换取他们的珍宝。\!兽人社会变得贫穷。\!现在我们尝试修复自我隔绝带来的破坏，同时也努力确保我们不会因此变得弱小，易于征服，就像当年必须被艾斯坎达拯救的那代兽人那样。
"I could listen to this stuff all day, cat.",这些事情我可以听上一整天，大猫。
It is great honor to Raskuja when human show interest in Barek Tor.\! \n[8] is good company for Raskuja. Raskuja wishes to talk more in future days.,人类对兽人产生兴趣，是拉斯库亚绝大的荣幸。\!\n[8]是拉斯库亚的好伙伴。拉斯库亚希望在未来的日子里谈论更多。
Count on it!,我都有点迫不及待了！
