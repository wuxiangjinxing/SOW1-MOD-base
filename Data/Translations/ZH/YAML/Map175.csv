"I guess you've made your intentions clear, huh?",这下你图穷匕见了，嗯？
"I have, \n[8].\! But have you?",没错，\n[8]。\!但你呢？
"The Temple would have me be some sort of fulfillment of a prophecy.\! What's one to do, Lysander?",圣殿希望我成为某种证明预言成真的人物。\!我该怎么办，莱森德？
"It depends on what you want.\! You could simply disappear, and not concern yourself with supernatural myths.\! But you're not going to do that, are you?",取决于你想要什么。\!你可以直接消失，这样就不用担心那些超自然神话了。\!但你不会那样做的，不是吗？
"These are my people.\! Every Veridian.\! Part of me wants to be what they want me to be, to save them from the darkness we all know is coming.\! Guess I never cared much about this new world that seems to be creeping in.",他们是我的人民。\!每个维尔迪亚人都是。\!我内心的某一部分想要成为他们期望中的人，把他们从即将到来的黑暗中拯救出来。\!看来我从来都不太喜欢这日渐从暗中滋生的新世界。
And what world is that?,具体是个怎样的世界呢？
"As children we are taught about a past that's so much greater, and men so much nobler.\! But it seems the legends of the past are forever gone.\! Now we're stuck with weak and petty leaders.\! Men of the past would give their lives to ensure a lasting peace, but now there is so much less hope, so much more cynicism.\! I've heard other Succession War orphans say the same.\! But to the generation before us, this attitude seems...\| revolutionary.\! Why? It seems so simple...",小时候，我们被教导，曾经有那么一个时代，比现在伟大的多，那时候的人也更为高尚。\!但看上去过去的传奇一去不复返了。\!现在我们被迫接受软弱无能的领导者。\!过去的人们愿意为了长久的和平献出生命，但现在希望越来越渺茫，随波逐流的犬儒主义者越来越多。\!我听其他在继位战争时成为孤儿的人也表达过类似看法。\!不过，跟上一代人相比，这种态度……\|是颠覆性的\!为什么？原因其实很简单……
"In an age of lies, the truth is an act of dissent.\! And the greatest enemy of evil is an awoken people - those who feel just as you do.\! You know, it is quite intriguing to me, \n[8], when we consider the rebellion of General Antares.\! Here we now stand, opposed to our own government, just as he was.\! Perhaps it was Antares who could see further ahead than any of us.\! History will likely see you as the inheritor of the very rebellion you fought to put down...",在充满谎言的时代，说出真相反而成为了叛逆行径。\!邪恶的最大敌人就是觉醒的人民——那些和你感同身受的人。\!你知道吗，\n[8]，想起之前安塔瑞斯将军的叛乱，我突然觉得很有意思。\!我们现在就像他一样，在反对我们自己的统治者。\!也许安塔瑞斯的目光才是比我们任何人都更加长远。\!你亲手接过了自己最初前去镇压的那场起义的大旗……或许你会以这个身份被载入史册吧。
