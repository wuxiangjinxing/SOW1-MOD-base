Chapter 27: Return to the Origin,第27章：回到原点
"Your excellency, the Nephilim Army has reached the capital!\! What are we to do?",陛下，圣灵军团已经推进到首都了！\!我们要怎么办？
What in blazes do you mean?\! Go out and fight them!\! You are wasting time!,你这是什么意思？\!出去跟他们打啊！\!别在这里浪费时间！
"My Emperor, we have already swept all of Armitage for conscripts.\! There's nothing left. We no longer have the strength to fight back.\! Only a handful of exhausted veterans from past battles...",陛下，我们已经在阿米塔吉进行过彻底的征兵了。\!我们没人了。我们已经没有能力去反击了。\!只剩一点儿在往日战斗中筋疲力竭的老兵了……
"Then the veterans should gather whoever they can, man the walls, and repel the Orphan's pathetic army!\! Do I have to do everything myself or can you manage this?!",那么那些老兵就应该不惜一切代价组织队伍、守卫城墙，然后打退那个孤儿的散兵游勇！\!朕是必须什么都得亲自动手呢，还是说你能把活干好？
"Y-yes, your excellency...",遵、遵命，陛下。
"Most of their army...\| skinny youths, or old men...",他们军队的大部分人……\|都是瘦骨嶙峋的青年或老人…
"That's just whatever scraps Casamir still has left... they should be ripe for surrender.\! But the Zanatus cultists will also be here with powerful and merciless warriors.\! Regarding the demoralized remnants of the Imperial Army...\| Casamir would sacrifice their lives just to stave off the inevitable for a few moments.\! I think you know what to do, \n[8].",这就是卡萨米尔仅剩的残兵败将……他们应该已经穷途末路，只能投降了。\!但信奉扎纳图斯的异教徒也会和强大且冷酷的战士一同登场。\!至于那些士气低迷的帝国残军……\|卡萨米尔大概会为了多活几秒钟而把他们牺牲掉。\!我想你知道该怎么做，\n[8]。
"""An army of lambs can become lions at a moment's notice""...\! Do you see that balcony, atop the Imperial Palace?\! That's where they watched me executed in cold blood, and where they cheered and celebrated it...\! these people would have me thrown to the dogs.",“羊群可以在一瞬间变成狮子……”\!你看到皇宫顶层的那个阳台了吗？\!那就是他们冷血地看着我被处决的地方，他们在那里欢呼庆祝……\!这些人甘愿把我扔去喂狗。
"No...\| you bend the knee to Casamir, your life is forfeit!!!",不……\|自从你们向卡萨米尔屈服的那一刻起，你们的死期即至！！！
Uhhhh..... \n[8]?\! What's goin' on?!,呃……\n[8]？\!你怎么了？
By Donar...,多纳尔在上……
"We have been in an impossible situation! Facing death at the hands of the culists for dessertion, or against you in combat!\! We thank you for showing mercy...\| please accept this on the behalf of the people of Armitage.",之前我们被逼入了绝境！要么做个逃兵被异教徒处死，要么就是在战场上面对你们！\!我们感谢您的仁慈……\|这是阿米塔吉人民的谢礼，请您收下。
