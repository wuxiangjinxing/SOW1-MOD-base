"So much has changed, Lysander...",变化太大了，莱森德……
It is like waking from a dream to reveal a nightmarish reality.,这就像从梦中醒来，直面一个噩梦般的现实。
Can you tell me what happened to you after the battle at Fort Eureeka?,能告诉我尤里卡堡战役后你都经历了什么吗？
"By the time I'd returned to the inner keep, Diana had already evacuated with her group.\! I gathered everyone else I could find and we slipped out the rear sully port into the river, where we threw together makeshift rafts and floated down the Herald under the cover of night.\! Myself, Raskuja, Narima, and Sybil regrouped and made our way to the capital...\| just in time to watch your execution.\! The moronic cheers of the crowd nearly vexed me enough to blow my cover...",当我回到内堡时，戴安娜已经和她的团队撤离了。\!我召集了我能找到的所有人，然后从后方暗门溜进了河里，在那里我们拼凑了临时木筏，在夜色的掩护下顺着先驱河漂流而下。\!我、拉斯库亚、娜瑞玛和茜比尔重新集结并前往首都……\|正好赶上你的处决。\!群氓那愚蠢的欢呼声让我愤怒的几乎暴露身份……
"Cheers, huh.",欢呼声，哈。
"It was an explosion of emotion across the spectrum.\! It was that moment that tipped the scales, so that the coming disaster was apparent not only to the clever, but to all.\! In the coming months, I attempted to rally opposition forces among the enraged nobles who remained, but the dark knight and his black dragon had an answer for everything we tried.\! Following his dragon's roar was always death and suffering.\! No one could stand up to him, as he acted as the vanguard for an army of powerful cultist mages, and Casamir's Imperial elite troops.\! After witnessing the power of that dark knight, and your...\| resurrection...\| I no longer scoff at the supernatural, but now seek to decipher it.\! After some time in exile, I reunited with my friends, and we caught wind that Diana had organized a resistance force dedicated to protecting the children from the mass kidnappings.\! We sprang into action, taking advantage of the weakness here at Eastwall Fortress, and held out just long enough for you to arrive.",各色情绪都在那时爆发。\!正是那一刻，天平倾斜了。以至于不仅是聪明人，所有人都看到了即将到来的灾难。\!接下来的几个月里，我试图在剩余的愤怒贵族中集结反对力量，但黑暗骑士和他的黑龙总能够对抗我们的努力。\!紧接着龙吟声的总是死亡和痛苦。\!他在强大的邪教法师军队以及卡萨米尔的帝国精锐部队中都担任先锋，没有人能对抗他。\!在目睹了那个黑暗骑士的力量和你的……\|复活之后……\|我不再对超自然现象嗤之以鼻，而是试图破译它。\!在流亡一段时间后，我与朋友们重聚。我们得到消息，戴安娜组织了一支抵抗力量，保护儿童免遭大规模绑架。\!我们立即采取行动，利用了东城要塞这里的弱点夺取了它，一直坚持到你的归来。
"It's infuriating, what they're doing.\! Can't convince the grown-ups, so they have to tear families apart and brainwash the young.",他们的所作所为令人愤慨。\!说服不了大人，就拆散家庭，给小孩子洗脑。
"It is indeed unforgivable, but this also presents an opportunity.\! This is a war of good against evil now... no mercy required for the enemy.\! Only their total destruction will heal the land.\! This is quite a bit more simple than reconciliation with a defeated foe.",这确实是不可饶恕的，但这也是一个机会。\!这是一场正义与邪恶的战争了……不需要对敌人手下留情。\!只有将他们彻底毁灭才能治愈这片土地。\!这比与战败的敌人和解要简单直接得多。
"I was thinking just that, and you said it.\! Knowing you're the ""good"" in that good versus evil does make things simple.",我正是这么想的，而你说了出来。\!知道自己是这场善恶之争中的“善”确实让事情变得简单。
"...So long as you stay good, \n[8].",……只要你保持在善的一方，\n[8]。
