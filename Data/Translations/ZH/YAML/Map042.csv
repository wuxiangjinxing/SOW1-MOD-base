Thank you for coming prior to your army's departure.\! You certainly are the trusting type...,感谢你能在自己军队开拨之前过来见我。\!你很容易信任别人啊……
Who are you?,你是谁？
My name is Lysander.,我叫莱森德。
Wha... Lysander?!\! General Lysander? Of the Imperial Army?,什……莱森德？！\!莱森德将军？帝国军部的那位？
Yes. I know your name from the Academy.\! Seems we never crossed paths before.,正是。我在学院时听过你的名字。\!好像之前我们都没碰过面。
I just thought you would be older...,我只是以为你年纪会大一点儿……
Heh heh....,呵呵……
...How did you know where to find me?,……你怎么知道上哪儿找我的？
All that matters now is that I come to you with a warning.\! News is already spreading... Empress Florina was murdered.,重点是我给你带来了一个警告。\!消息已经传开了……芙洛里娜女皇是被谋杀的。
"War is imminent.\! The Empress's death has opened old wounds, sparked old rivalries.\! The two strongest Dukes, Lothair and Terenor, have mobilized their armies.\! It's civil war, and it's just a matter of time.",战争风雨欲来。\!女皇之死揭开了旧日的伤疤，往昔的恩怨也随之复发。\!两位最强大的公爵，洛泰尔和特瑞诺，已经在动员他们的军队了。\!内战肯定会打，只是时间问题罢了。
"Lysander, there's got to be more to this... and you know who.",莱森德，我们不妨把话讲得透一点……你知道实际上是谁。
"Careful what you say, \n[8].\! The Prime Minister is very popular among the people.\! He has surrounded himself with powerful allies...",\n[8]，当心祸从口出。\!首相人气很高。\!周边又有强大的盟友拱卫……
"Then you believe he is responsible for the murder?\! Come on, just admit it!\! He's been obsessed with becoming Emperor for so long.\! He would do anything...",所以你确实相信谋杀是他做的？\!拜托，利落地承认吧！\!他心心念念要做皇帝都这么久了。\!他会不惜一切……
You must keep your voice down.,你必须放低音量。
"There are those among us in the Imperial Army who think as you do.\! Do not act rashly. Casamir will make a mistake eventually.\! For now, you should stay with the Temple.\! When I have collected enough evidence to expose Casamir, I will find you.",我们帝国军队中也有想法跟你一样的人。\!不要轻举妄动。卡萨米尔迟早会犯错的。\!眼下，你应当和圣殿的人待在一起。\!在收集到足够的证据来揭露卡萨米尔后，我会找到你的。
"Until then, I trust you will keep this meeting to yourself?",在那之前，我相信你会把我们这次的会面深埋心底了？
Of course...,当然…
