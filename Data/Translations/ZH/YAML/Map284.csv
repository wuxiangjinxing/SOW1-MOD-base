Sir Jaromir...,贾洛米爵士…
Donar's mercy...\| you live and breathe.,多纳尔怜悯……\|你还活着。
"Only by the mercy of the Nephilim Army. In truth, I should not.",只是靠圣灵大军的怜悯。事实上，我不应该活着。
...\| Why?,……\|为什么？
I...\| am a coward.,我……\|是个懦夫。
How could you speak such words?,你怎么能这么说？
"You do not see it? Sir Jaromir...\| I am a Swordmistress of Sayunaa, sworn to give my life for the integrity and sovereignty of my homeland.\! Now that I have traded my honor to spare my life, that title rings hollow.\! Sayunaa was subdued with nothing but words from the Veridian enemy.",你看不出来吗？贾洛米爵士……\|我是萨育纳的女剑士，誓死要保卫祖国的完整和主权。\!现在我已经用我的荣誉换取了我的生命，这个头衔听起来十分的虚伪。\!萨育纳被维尔迪亚敌人用三言两语制服了。
"Swordmistress of Sayunaa...\| what a grand title. Fitting, for a grand woman.",萨育纳的女剑士……\|多么伟大的头衔。对于一个伟大的女人来说，很合适。
"I do understand fully, the need to put one's life below that of your sovereign. But, if I could share some insights from my talks with \n[8].\! I believe, if \n[5] were to opine, \n[5] would highlight that we live in an age of profound evil. That, as \n[5] would say ""lofty concepts"", such as reason and honor, have all but been thrown to the wind.\! That your chosen course was far wiser, that you not waste the gift Donar has asked you to use to better this world.\! And to the last part, I cannot disagree.",将一个人的生命置于主权之下的必要性我并不能完全理解。但是，请让我分享一些我从与\n[8]的谈话中得到的见解。\!我相信，如果\n[5]发表意见，\n[5]会强调我们生活在一个充满邪恶的时代。正如\n[5]所说，“崇高的概念”，例如理性和荣誉，都已被抛到九霄云外。\!他会说你选择的路线要明智得多，没有浪费多纳尔让你用来将这个世界变得更加美好的天赋。\!对于这最后一部分，我不能不同意。
"To dispose of these so-called lofty concepts as a means of gaining advantage...\| That is the way of the schemer. The charlatan.\! It is, so...\| if you'll forgive the analogy...\| Veridian.",放弃所谓的崇高概念以获取优势……\|这是阴谋家的做法。是江湖骗子的做法。\!这是如此的……\|请原谅这个类比……\|维尔迪亚做派。
Ha. Of course.,哈。当然。
"Sir Jaromir, I believe I am hearing you correctly. There is wisdom in \n[8]'s philosophy from a certain point of view.",贾洛米爵士，我相信我听明白了。\n[8]的哲学从某种角度来看是有智慧的。
If you had resisted... if you had gone against the wishes of your leaders...,如果你当初反抗了……如果你违背了领袖们的意愿……
"The military of Casamir was beyond anything we could have imagined. Had we resisted, our defenses would surely have been crushed. And...",卡萨米尔军队的强远超我们的想象。如果我们当时反抗，我们的防御肯定会被粉碎。而且……
"So too would be the soul of Sayunaa. It would take generations to recover, if at all.\! What is more fundamental to that which defines you? And your homeland?\! I believe Donar would see it that, Swordmistress of Sayunaa, you have fulfilled your duty. By surviving.",萨育纳的灵魂也会被毁灭。即使有可能恢复，也需要几代人的时间。\!还有什么比定义你和你的祖国的东西更根本的呢？\!我相信多纳尔会认为，萨育纳的女剑士，通过生存下来，你已经履行了你的职责。
...Sir Jaromir...\| I did not anticipate this. But it seems Donar has seen fit to deliver you to Sayunaa.\! We truly need your aid...,……贾洛米爵士……\|我没有预料到这一点。但看来似乎是多纳尔将你送到萨育纳来的。\!我们真的需要你的帮助……
...Just as I once did yours.,……就像我曾经需要你的帮助一样。
Donar watch over us...,多纳尔保佑我们……
