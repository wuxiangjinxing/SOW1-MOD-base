"Ey there, poindexter! Boy am I relieved you're still in one piece!",哎你好呀，书呆子！好家伙，知道你一切都好我真是松了一口气！
...Really?,……真的？
"Well yeah! You're the man with all the answers.\! Doesn't even matter what subject, y'can always get a little dose of enlightenment from talkin' to Lysander.\! This, guy... haha... welcome back to the club!",当然啦！你这家伙什么都懂。\!无论是什么主题，你总能从与莱森德的交谈中获得一点启迪。\!这家伙……哈哈……欢迎回来！
"Thanks.\! Though I must disagree. The more time goes by, the more I realize I do not know.",谢谢。\!尽管我必须反对。时间过的越久，我就越发察觉我的无知。
"Heh, yeah whatever.\! Hey, speakin' o that, I was wonderin'. Why don't we just make a bunch'a those airships, and just drop bombs on the bad guys?\! No fuss no muss, easy win. Right??",呵，是啊，怎样都好。\!哎，说到那个，我在想。为什么我们不造一堆飞艇，然后直接把炸弹扔到那些坏蛋的脑袋上了事？\!飞艇升空，胜利轻松。对吧？？
"It's been a long time since we used airships as weapons, and for good reason.\! For the price of one airship, one could instead equip an entire army with cannons.\! Because of the prohibitive costs, and because of recent developments such as firearms and war dragons, airships have become ""White elephants"" in war.",我们已经很久不用飞艇作武器了，这么做的理由也很充分。\!一艘飞艇的价格，已经等同于用大炮武装整支军队的花费。\!由于飞艇造价高昂，再加上近年来火器、战龙等军备兵种的发展，飞艇成为了战场上的“鸡肋”。
"White elephants? Ya mean like pink elephants, m'friend?",鸡肋？你是说像那些发育不良只能在屋顶扑腾几下的弱鸡一类吗，我的朋友？
"Heh...\! White Elephants meaning, they're too valuable to risk losing.\! And that makes them virtually useless in a combat role.\! They are, in essence, expensive toys that have no place in a serious battlefield.\! However, when modified to serve as an armored transport, they can be invaluable. And that's just how we'll be using them.",啊哈……\!所谓鸡肋是指，飞艇太贵了，没人亏得起。\!这使得它们在战斗中几乎毫无用处。\!从本质上讲，它们是昂贵的玩具，在严肃的战场上没什么立足之地。\!然而，如果改装成战场交通工具，它们的价值是无可估量的。而这就是我们将要使用它们的方式。
"See what I mean?\! ALL the answers! Love this guy!\! Hey, that airship got a mini-bar somewhere?\! I'm feelin' overdue, 'n mighty thirsty.",明白我的意思了吗？\!什么都懂！爱死你这家伙啦！\!嘿，那艘飞艇里能不能搞个小吧台？\!我酒瘾犯了，口渴难耐啊。
"Hmmm, I believe that would be an acceptable modification.\! If you believe it will enhance our army's morale.",嗯，我相信这是一个可以接受的改造方案。\!如果你认为它会提高我军士气的话。
"Now we're talkin', haha!",这就对了嘛，哈哈！
