"\c[1]Year 974 of the Donari Calendar, the continent of Veridia during the zenith of the War of Veridian Succession.\! The Empire of Veridia has long maintained a diffuse power structure, seeing its vast lands and resources governed by multiple powerful nobles, officials of the Donari Temple, private guildmasters, and the central government ruled directly by the Emperor.\!

Even foreign powers saw fit to join the conflict.",\c[1]多纳尔历974年，维尔迪亚大陆正处于继位战争的白热化阶段。\!维尔迪亚帝国长期以来一直保持权力分散结构，其广阔的土地和资源由不同群体共同统治，包括多个权势贵族、多纳尔圣殿官员、私人行会会长以及由皇帝直接统治的中央政府。\!不久前，前皇帝艾比斯十八世英年早逝，帝国陷入动荡。最初的小分歧逐渐失控，演变成战争总动员。甚至连外国势力也要加入这场冲突。
"\c[1]The young Duchess Florina Iblis, a distant relative of the former Emperor, was the closest family connection alive.\!

"\c[1]Captain Antares. Riding high off a recent victory at Westerfeld, his services have been requested by Duke Terenor.\!
