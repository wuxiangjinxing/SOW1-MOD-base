"Rimorgue has fallen.\! Casamir just lost his best troops, and he's about to lose the capital.",里莫格已经沦陷。\!卡萨米尔刚刚失去了他最精锐的部队，首都也即将被攻破。
"\c[1]Yes, the little empire has outlived its usefulness.\! But much progress has been made.\! We have all but erased the Donari Temple from memory!\! Now, we need but rid ourselves of the False One, and everything will fall into place quite easily.",\c[1]是的，这个小小的帝国已经没用了。\!但是事情已经取得了很大进展。\!我们已经几乎把多纳尔圣殿从记忆中抹去了！\!现在，我们只需要摆脱伪灵，之后一切都会顺风顺水。
"The ""Little Empire""?\! How cavalier you are.\! I could have turned the tide against them.\! It is such a waste, but there is no point now, is there?",“小小的帝国”？\!你心态可真好。\!我本可以力挽狂澜。\!真是浪费。但现在说这些也没有意义了，不是吗？
"\c[1]Oh, but you see, this is no bother. Let the False One dispose of Casamir for us. I've grown quite weary of the burden of his existence.\! The False One will come for the Lightfury... but instead, \n[5] will find only death.\! And so... will bring to a close the final chapter in the age of human ignorance.",\c[1]哦，但是你看，这并不是问题。就让伪灵帮我们处理掉卡萨米尔吧。我已经厌倦了他活着时给我们带来的那些负担。\!伪灵为寻找光明之怒而来……但，\n[5]只会找到死亡。\!如此……人类无知时代的最后一章也将落幕。
\n[8] has conquered the world in a matter of months.\! What makes you so confident that you'll be the one who beats \n[1]?,\n[8]在几个月内就征服了世界。\!你怎么如此肯定自己能成为击败\n[1]的人？
"\c[1]...\| Because I am the first who will attack \n[1] where \n[5] is vulnerable.\! \n[28] rise to power has made \n[1] arrogant, and severely lacking in foresight!\! \n[8] stands upon precarious ground and does not realize it.\! One only needs recognize this weakness, and act on it. Give it a little tip in the right direction.\! In the end, you will see true elegance of execution, my champion.",\c[1]……\|因为我会是第一个在\n[1]弱点处攻击\n[5]的人。\!\n[28]掌权使\n[1]变得傲慢，严重缺乏远见！\!\n[8]并没有意识到他们正处于危险之中。\!我只需要认识到这一弱点，并就此采取行动。往正确的方向轻轻一推。\!最后，你会看到真正优雅的执行，我的英雄。
