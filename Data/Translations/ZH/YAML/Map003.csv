Chapter 6: Journey to Lemelin,第6章：莱梅林之旅
"The time for subtle measures has passed. Tidereavers, our objective is Fort Naxos. Surround that Fortress and have no mercy.",暗中行动的时期过去了。噬浪团的勇士们，我们的目标就是那座纳克索斯堡。包围堡垒，毫不留情！
"They sent Kuroda?! Hell's bells, they're not messin' around. That guy's got killing in his blood.\! \n[8], some powerful folks want your hide.",他们把黑田派来了？！我的妈，他们是认真的。那家伙流淌着杀戮的血液。\!\n[8]，一些有权势的人想要你的命。
"\n[8], we could use your knowledge here.",\n[8]，我们需要你的知识。
...The Temple needs *my* advice? I hardly think...,……圣殿需要“我”的建议？我很难相信……
The Temple is not accustomed to the open battlefield.,圣殿不常在开阔地带战斗。
"Okay...\| well, we're outnumbered. The standard move is to secure a defensive bottleneck.\! We might try to take the small forts by the river. It's slightly better than being overwhelmed here.",好吧……\|嗯，敌人数量比我们多，常规做法是守住交通要道。\!可以试着把河边的小堡垒拿下来，比被在这里压着打要好些。
"Right. We will follow your command, \n[8]. Donar be with us.",好的。\n[8]，我们会听从你的指挥。多纳尔与我们同在。
"Looks like we're right on time.\! \n[8], don't count us out just yet.",看来我们来得正是时候。\!\n[8]，可别算漏我们。
"The Army's going to have our heads if they find out about this!\! Are you sure you're okay with this, guys?!",要是被正规军发现了，我们是要掉脑袋的！\!伙计们，你们确定这没问题吗？！
I've never known \n[8] to be sinister in any way.\! There's something fishy going on and \n[8] needs our help!,我就没见过\n[8]有罪恶的一面。\!肯定有什么阴谋，而\n[8]需要我们的帮助！
"That's very gutsy of you, Jules...",你可真有勇气，朱尔斯……
"We're way past worryin' about the Army now, kiddos, we're criminals now.\! But no time for belly achin'. Let's get our butts over to \n[8]'s position on the double!",我们早就不用担心正规军了，小崽子们，咱们现在是罪犯啦。\!不过现在不是抱怨的时候。我们快马加鞭援助\n[8]吧！
"...Is that you, Abi?!",……是你吗，阿比？！
Dear brother!\! Oh my stars... I cannot describe how relieved I am to see you here!,哥哥！\!我的天哪……你知道能在这见到你我有多安心吗！
"You too, Abi.\! I'm so proud of you - the Temple seems to have you doing some important tasks now!",我也一样，阿比。\!我真为你感到骄傲。看来圣殿开始给你派一些重要的任务了！
"Yes... it is very challenging, but this is what I wanted.\! But... surely you were not sent here by your leaders...\| Oh, Jules, what have you done?\! You are always giving yourself up for others.",是的……它们非常有挑战性，但这就是我想要的。\!但……你肯定不是上级主官派来的吧……\|哎呀，朱尔斯，你都做了什么？\!你总是为了别人牺牲你自己。
"Yeah, yeah, I guess so.\! But now I'm with you, so it can't be all that bad, right?",是，是，好像是吧。\!但我现在在你身边了，所以也没那么糟，对吧？
"Some day you'll live for you and no one else, Jules...",朱尔斯，总有一天你要为自己而活的……
"Aw, don't worry about me.\! Let's just get through this battle in one piece, Abi!",好啦，别担心我啦。\!咱们一块儿平平安安打赢这场仗吧，阿比！
"I will not throw away my life for this employer, for this mission...",我可不会为了这个雇主、这项任务卖命……
