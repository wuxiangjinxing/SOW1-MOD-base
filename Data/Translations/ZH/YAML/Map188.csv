"Ah, \n[8] of the Nephilim Army.\! You have become quite the problem for the Veridians, you know.\! Prime Minister Cyrus, at your service.",啊，圣灵军团的\n[8]。\!对维尔迪亚人来说，您已经成了一个相当棘手的人物，您知道吗。\!塞鲁士首相，乐意为您效劳。
Thank you for agreeing to meet with us.\! We have much to discuss.\! We understand that your nation has been subdued by the Empire of Archaelus.,感谢您同意与我们会面。\!我们有很多事要讨论。\!我们得知您的国家已经臣服于阿开勒斯帝国。
"Subdued? Aha, in that we move our armies at their whim, yes.\! But as you can see, we still have our culture.\! Our children are not being torn from their parents, our icons and our temples remain standing.\! One cannot say the same for the rest of the world.\! Do you expect us to give up that protection, for a chance to become independent again?",臣服？啊哈，从我们的军队供他们驱使的角度来看，是的。\!但正如你所见，我们仍然保留着我们的文化。\!我们不用妻离子散，我们的圣像和圣殿仍然屹立不倒。\!其他国家就不一样了。\!您指望我们会为了获得再次独立的机会，而放弃这种保护吗？
"Prime Minister, this ""alliance"" is a sham!\! They'll come for your temples, your culture, and your children, eventually.\! You've got to take that chance, Cyrus... it's the only smart way to go!",首相，这个“联盟”就是一场骗局！\!他们最终也会针对你们的圣殿、文化和儿童。\!你必须抓住这个机会，塞鲁士……这是唯一明智的选择！
"Is that so?\! And what makes you different?\! You've come here armed for battle.\! Are we to simply trust yet another Veridian that they will not come as conquerers?\! No, \n[8], we are not as helpless as you think.\! The Sayunaari people have endured for thousands of years, and we will for another.",是这样吗？\!那你又能给我们什么呢？\!你是全副武装来到这里的。\!我们是否可以就这么轻信另一个维尔迪亚人，相信你不会成为另一个征服者呢？\!不，\n[8]，我们并不像你想象的那样无助。\!萨育纳人已经存在了数千年，并且会继续存在下去。
Kill them both!!,把他们都杀掉！！
They have fallen under the magic of Zanatus...,他们中了扎纳图斯的魔法……
They're going to regret that...,他们会为此后悔的……
