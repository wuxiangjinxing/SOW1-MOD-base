Seems like they've put all their hopes in Stormrook's defense.\! Could we be the first in a thousand years to conquer Stormrook Castle from the east?,看起来他们已将所有希望寄托在风鸦堡的防御上了。\!我们能成为千年来第一个从东面进攻并成功征服风鸦堡的军队吗？
Victory over Casamir is all but inevitable. The challenge will be to minimize casualties during this difficult final stretch.,我们必将战胜卡萨米尔。唯一的挑战是在这艰难的最后阶段尽量减少人员伤亡。
What gives? Aren't you looking forward to taking that weasel off the throne?,怎么了？难道你不急着把那只黄鼠狼从王位上拽下来吗？
"These are the homelands of the Empire, and the people may not desire our presence as others have.\! However, the unfortunate truth is that the war will not end as long as Casamir lives...",这是帝国的领地，这里的人可能不像其他人那样欢迎我们。\!不幸的是，只要卡萨米尔还没有被打败，战争就不会结束……
Nothing could stand between my blade and Casamir's throat.,没有什么能阻止我取下卡萨米尔的首级。
"My own desire for revenge aside, Beatrix says that the last Nephilim shrine is inside the Imperial Palace.\! She hasn't been wrong yet...",撇开我自己的报复心不谈，碧翠丝说最后一座圣灵神殿就在皇宫内。\!她还没说错过……
\n[8]...\| I need you to listen.\! You should not claim the last divine weapon...,\n[8]……\|听我说。\!你不应该去拿最后的神器……
...Why not??,……为什么不呢？？
"I see the way you Nephilim act around those shrines.\! You are hypnotized.\! A voice calling out to you, compelling you to seize your destiny.\! It is unsettling, and I am not the only one who has noticed.\! If the purpose of finding these weapons is to defeat Casamir, what use is pursuing the Lightfury if you must defeat him to get it?",我看透了你们圣灵在这些神殿周围的表现。\!你们被催眠了。\!有个声音在呼唤你们，强迫你们去抓住自己的命运。\!这令人不安，而且我不是唯一这么想的人。\!找到光明之怒的目的是打败卡萨米尔，可是你却要先打败他才能得到这把武器，追求这把武器又有何意义呢？
"I was once a street urchin, begging for a small piece of bread.\! But look what I've built for myself now.\! You'd have me abandon this path?",我曾经是一个流浪儿，在街上乞讨为生。\!可看看我现在的成就。\!你要我放弃这条路吗？
"You provoked us into a war with Sayunaa, \n[8]...\| And now flirt with the role not of liberator, but conqueror...",你挑起了我们与萨育纳的战争，\n[8]……\|而现在你开始向征服者，而不是解放者的角色靠拢……
"It may have been in a former life, but I still remember. I still hear the sound of Casamir's guns as they tore my body to shreds.\! I still remember the roars of the crowd, cheering the execution of a traitor - my last sense before everything went black.\! ...And yet, I stand before you by the will of Donar. Perhaps the real \n[8] is still dead?\! What do you think, Lysander? Am I just some kind of divine artifice, a weapon sent to right Tahnra's wrongs?\! These questions torture me... every day. I have no other purpose than this, Lysander.",这也许是前世发生的事，但我还记得。我依旧能听到卡萨米尔的步枪把我的身体撕碎时的声响。\!我仍然记得人群的高喊，为叛徒被处决而欢呼——这就是我在死前最后的感受。\!……然而，多纳尔的意志让我站在这里。也许真正的\n[8]依旧是死的？\!你怎么看，莱森德？我只是某种被派来纠正塔恩拉错误的神圣工具吗？\!这些问题折磨着我……日复一日。除此以外我的存在没有目的，莱森德。
"You swore to be my right hand. But it seems now, you would feel more at peace if you resigned from the Nephilim Army.",你发誓做我的臂膀。不过现在看来，可能离开圣灵军团会让你更安心。
...\| Is that what you want?,……\|那是你想要的吗？
"Please, I know you better than that. You choose your own path.",少来这套，我知道你的为人。你从来只选择合自己意的道路。
"...Casamir must be destroyed, for the good of Tahnra. Only you have the power to do so...",……为了塔恩拉，我们必须消灭卡萨米尔。只有你有能力做到……
"Let us put an end to this war together, \n[8]...",让我们一起结束这场战争吧，\n[8]……
We will. Just hold out a little longer...,我们会的。再坚持一会儿就好了……
