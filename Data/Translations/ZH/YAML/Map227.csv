ENGLISH,ZH-cn
"Honored to finally speak to you in the flesh, Paladin.\! Shame that it has taken this long.",圣骑士，很荣幸终于能亲自与你交谈。\!很遗憾要花这么长时间。
"I know it doesn't matter anymore, but one of my biggest regrets is not wising up to Zanatus earlier.\! I'd have slit Casamir's throat in a heartbeat and put a quick stop to all the child kidnapping nonsense.\! I'd have preferred to kill you in combat, not destroy your soul by kidnapping your son.",我知道这已经不重要了，但我最大的遗憾之一就是没能及早发觉扎纳图斯的真面目。\!我本会立刻割开卡萨米尔的喉咙，并迅速制止所有绑架儿童的闹剧。\!我宁愿在战斗中杀死你，也不愿通过绑架你的儿子来摧毁你的灵魂。
...Why did you destroy the Temple?,……你为什么要毁掉圣殿？
"All I did was expedite the inevitable.\! The temple was just another part of an old paradigm, one on life support because people like you.",我所做的一切只是加速了注定到来的历史进程罢了。\!圣殿只是旧时代的另一部分，因为你这样的人而垂死挣扎。
A man like you lead down this path of bloodshed.\! Unfortunate.,像你这样的人最终走上了一条血腥的道路。\!真不幸。
"This coming from Diana, the ""Goddess of War"", they call you.\! This mighty Paladin whose name inspires terror... and whose lifetime of crusade has spilt blood that would turn the seas red.\! I heard how you killed Casamir...\| Is this how you and your order have always operated?\! If so, perhaps you're more honest than I give credit.\! Or more warped by what you've become.","这话居然从人称""战争女神""的戴安娜口中说出。\!这个光是听到名字就让人胆战心惊的强大圣骑士……在贯穿你一生的圣战中所制造的鲜血能将大海染红。\!我听说过你是如何杀死卡萨米尔的……\|你和你的教团一直都是这样行事的吗？\!如果是这样，也许你比我以为的要更诚实。\!或者比我想象的要变得更加扭曲。"
You don't know what I've become.,你不知道我变成什么样了。
"I see it in your eyes, you and I are nothing more than killing machines.\! We've lost everything else to become what we are.\! Is all this power worth it?\! Do those you fight for deserve your sacrifice?",我从你眼中看的出来，你和我不过是杀人机器。\!为了成为现在的样子，我们失去了一切。\!为了这些力量，值得吗？\!你为之奋斗的人值得你的牺牲吗？
"But having pursued my convictions as I see fit, and not giving myself to a band of ingrates who will never be able to pay me back their due, my mind is still clear.\! Soon, we will use our power to kill Zanatus, and if there is justice in this world, everyone will then learn what they've taken from you.",但因为我一直在按自己的方式追求我的信念，没有把自己托付给一群永远无法回报我的忘恩负义的人，我依然保持着一颗清醒的头脑。\!很快，我们将用我们的力量杀死扎纳图斯，如果这个世界上还有正义，那么每个人都会知道他们从你身上夺走了什么。
