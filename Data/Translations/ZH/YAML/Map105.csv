Might I steal a few moments of your time?,我可以占用你一些时间吗？
"Of course, Lysander.\! Though, I am not as interesting as \n[8], so I fear you will be disappointed.",当然了，莱森德。\!不过，我没有\n[8]那么有趣，所以我担心你会失望。
"As you may know, I am not a devotee to the Donari doctrine.\! And you are famed for being perhaps the strictest adherent alive.",您可能也知道，我并非多纳尔教义的信徒。\!而您则以身为最严守戒律的信徒而知名。
One could say that...,也许是吧……
"May I ask,\| do you see your beliefs as the most correct, and righteous?\! Compared with, for example, the Followers of Zanatus?",我想请教下，\|您觉得您的信仰是最正确、最正义的吗？\!跟其他的信徒，例如扎纳图斯的追随者，相比如何呢？
"The Followers of Zanatus are wicked, and the wicked shall be crushed. It is very simple.",扎纳图斯的追随者是邪恶的，邪恶必将被粉碎。这很简单。
"Indeed...\| And if you were to read the minds of these Zanatus worshipers, what do you think you would see?\! Would they not have the same adversarial conviction?\! That, perhaps, these adherents to Zanatus act and live with their own sense of righteousness?",确实……\|如果你能阅读这些扎纳图斯崇拜者的内心，你觉得你会看到什么？\!我们在他们眼里不也一样吗？\!或许，这些扎纳图斯的追随者在以他们自己的正义感行事并生活？
"These ponderings are a little dull to me.\! Some things are, and some things aren't.\! No need to play Devil's Advocate all the time.",这类思考对我来说有些乏味。\!有些事物的性质比较模糊，但也有些的很清晰。\!不用凡事都尝试从对方的角度考虑。
I... suppose I have become quite the nuisance to you now.,我想……我现在已经令你相当厌烦了。
"It's alright. Philosophers often wish to question the intensity of the Temple's resolve.\! After you have witnessed how the Zanatus cultists conduct themselves, you will no longer see them as misunderstood outcasts.\! At the risk of sounding curt...\! It's best you just let me fulfill my role in peace, knowing that you can continue to live in a world in which you won't be burned alive for having divergent thoughts.",没事的。哲学家们经常质疑圣殿行事坚决的必要性。\!亲眼目睹扎纳图斯教徒的种种行径之后，你就不会把他们视为被误解的流亡者了。\!这话听起来可能有点生硬……\!但你只要让我不受干扰地完成我的使命就好，这样你就可以继续生活在一个不会因为思想分歧而被活活烧死的世界里。
...I must say this conversation has far exceeded my expectations.,……，这次的对话大大超出了我的预料。
Your expectations?,你的预料？
Oh...\| you know... I didn't mean...,呃……\|你懂的……我不是那个意思……
"So...\! Me Diana, me like smash bad guys.",就类似……\!“我，戴安娜，我爱砸坏蛋”？
Heh heh... point taken.\! I shall leave before I embarrass myself further...,呵呵……我知错了。\!为了不进一步丢脸，我先行告退了……
