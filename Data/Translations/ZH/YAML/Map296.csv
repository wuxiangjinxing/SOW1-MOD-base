ENGLISH,ZH-cn
Y'always wanted to say you were the best sword in the world.\! I wager ya probably earned that title by now.,你一直想说自己是世界最强剑士。\!我打赌你现在应该已经赢得了这个头衔。
"Master Seargent.\! Perhaps, but that was a different time.",军士长。\!也许吧，但那是另一个时代了。
It's real funny hearin' you still call me that.\! Bein' that you're a livin' nightmare now.\! Feels like a higher rank than Master Seargent.,听到你还这么叫我，真有意思。\!因为你现在是一个活生生的噩梦。\!感觉比军士长级别高。
"...Barnabas. There are two people in this world who'll always have my blade guarding their lives.\! \n[8], and you.",……巴纳巴斯。这个世界上，有两个人的生命是我要一辈子用我的武器守护的。\!那就是\n[8]，还有你。
"I'm touched, kid.\! I think I'd sooner ya kill me yerself than I boast about havin' a bodyguard like you.",我很感动，孩子。\!我想我宁愿你亲手杀了我，也不会吹嘘自己有你这样的保镖。
...So I've always held back my words when it came to you.\! Out of respect.,……所以，每次谈到你的时候，我总是三缄其口。\!出于尊重。
"Words'll not hurt me, boy.\! What's on yer mind?",语言伤害不了我，孩子。\!你在想什么呢？
You'll never see the world you want.\! Never.,你永远不会看到你想要的世界。\!永远不会。
"Yeah, what's it to ya?\! Doesn't mean I can't fight for it.\! Better'n the alternative, slaughterin' innocents for some insane cause.",是的，这与你有什么关系？\!但这并不意味着我不能为之奋斗。\!总比为了一些疯狂的事业而屠杀无辜的人要好。
"I've always hated people who think like you, Barnabas.\! You think your noble pursuit of peace is actually going to work?\! Perhaps for a short time, before the inevitable regression back to conflict.",我一直很讨厌像你这样的人，巴纳巴斯。\!你认为你对和平的崇高追求真的会奏效吗？\!也许只能是短时间的，在下一场不可避免的冲突回归之前。
"Nothin' a good war'll fix, right?",没什么是一场战争解决不了的，对吧？
"People are at their best when they are called to a cause.\! Without a dragon to slay, we sink into degeneracy.\! Case in point, squabbling, clueless nobles creating the conditions for the Succession War.\! A war in which you fought, and took many lives.\! A war that could have been avoided, had we not lapsed into complacency - enough so to allow such lowlives to reach the halls of power.\! But I know I'll never convince you.",当人们被召唤时，状态极佳。\!没有龙可杀，我们就会堕落。\!一个典型的例子是，贵族们争吵不休、毫无头绪，为继位战争提供了条件。\!这场战争你也参加了，并夺去了许多人的生命。\!如果我们没有陷入自满，这场战争本可以避免。我们的自满足以让这些卑鄙小人登上权力的殿堂。\!但我知道我说服不了你。
"Ya got that right, kid.\! Brain's too old to make heads or tails of what yer sayin'.\! Sounds more up \n[8]'s alley, heh heh.",你说对了，孩子。\!我的大脑太老旧了，无法理解你说的东西。\!听起来\n[8]会更感兴趣，嘿嘿。
"Take care, Master Seargent.\! You're a good man.\! It's too bad things turned out this way.",保重，军士长。\!你是个好人。\!事情发展到这一步令人惋惜。
