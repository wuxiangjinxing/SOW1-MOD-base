ENGLISH,ZH-cn
"Hello, dear Sister Diana...",你好，亲爱的戴安娜姐妹……
"Greetings, Sister Abigayle. Any luck with Nibbler?",你好，阿比盖尔姐妹。轻遥的事情有什么进展吗？
"Oh my stars... he is so stubborn! Surely he is mature enough to fly with me, but he simply refuses every time!",哦天呐……他太固执了！他已经足够成熟，可以和我一起飞行了，但他每次都拒绝！
That's strange. Considering how much you've cared for him.,这就奇怪了。考虑到你那么关心他。
It is...\| a little heartbreaking! And mystifying. Other dragons do not have a similar reaction and are amiable.\! Even Azuros has truly opened up to me.,这真是……\|有点令人心碎！而且令人困惑。其他龙没有类似的反应，都很和善。\!甚至连阿祖罗斯也已经真正向我敞开了心扉。
"You know, perhaps Nibbler would rather you stay on the ground.",你知道吗，也许轻遥宁愿你待在地上。
...Hmm??,……嗯？？
"He is young. From what you've told me about dragons, his mind is that of a human child.\! Perhaps he sees you with two legs, and no wings, and insists it's not safe for you soaring through the skies.",他还小。从你告诉我的关于龙的事情来看，他的思维相当于人类儿童的水平。\!也许他看到你有两条腿，没有翅膀，就觉得你在天空翱翔是不安全的。
Oh...\| you really think that's it?!,哦……\|你真的这么认为吗？！
"You would know better than I. However, lacking evidence to the contrary, isn't it nice to think that might be it?",你比我更懂他。但是在没有反面证据的情况下，这么想不是很好吗？
"Dear Diana, you have made my day!\! ...\| I have to tell you, he has opened my mind to who I truly am...",亲爱的戴安娜，你让我很开心！\!……\|我必须告诉你，他打开了我的心扉，让我了解到真正的自己…
And what's that?,是什么样的？
"Surely you already know...\| I have never once heard Donar's voice speak back to me. But I have heard my dragons, in their own way.",你肯定已经知道……\|我从来没有听到多纳尔回应我的祈求。但我听到了龙用它们的方式向我传达的话语。
The comforts of our world are indeed more tangible than that which lies beyond our understanding. No need to hide from this realization.,现世的慰藉比我们理解之外的东西更触手可及。无需躲避这项领悟。
There's more...\| it's Azuros. He has...\| actually begun to speak with me.\! He has started to call me Dragon-Speaker.,还有……\|阿祖罗斯。他其实……\|已经开始和我说话了。\!他开始叫我龙语者。
Come again?,再说一遍？
"He has lived many, many of our lifetimes. He knows our language. I think perhaps he knows all langauges...\! But he won't speak a word to anyone else. He has told me of other dragon monarchs.\! Kalytos the Red, Duros the Black, and Adorimetra the Gold, the true mother of all dragons. In his own words, that which created them is not so different from the power of the Nephilim...",他已经活了成百上千代人类的寿命了。他懂我们的语言。我觉得也许他通晓所有语言……\!但他不和其他任何人说话。他向我介绍了其他的龙王。\!红龙卡里多斯、黑龙杜洛斯，以及所有龙真正的龙母，金龙珥多魅拉。用他自己的话说，创造他们的力量与圣灵之力相仿……
Go on...,继续……
"That's all, for now. He can only think about that one thing. He keeps mentioning them as though they are family. It gives him great distress...",目前为止就这样了。他一直都在想那同一件事。一直提起他们，好像他们是家人一样。这让他非常苦恼……
"Sister Abigayle, Azuros may hold knowledge otherwise unvailable to us. Perhaps even extinct from our world completely.",阿比盖尔修女，阿祖罗斯可能拥有我们从别的地方无法获取的知识。甚至是已经完全从我们的世界中消失的知识。
"He is still highly distrustful of humans. I need time to understand him better, dear Diana...",他仍然对人类非常不信任。我需要时间来更好地了解他，亲爱的戴安娜……
"Of course. Donar be with you, Dragon-speaker.",当然。多纳尔与你同在，龙语者。
