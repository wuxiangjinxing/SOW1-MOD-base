"Pah, silly Veridians. If they will not properly acknowledge you as their savior, they deserve not the grace and beauty of my presence.",我呸，愚蠢的维尔迪亚人。如果他们不摆正态度承认你是他们的救世主，他们就不配得到这存在的优雅和美丽。
"...\| They will be ready in time. But for now, my role in Veridia is done. The Nephilim War is over, and Zanatus is dead.",……\|到时候他们会的。但眼下，我在维尔迪亚的使命已经完成。圣灵战争落幕，扎纳图斯灭亡。
"Indeed! A well-done demon, burned to a crisp by the divine fires of Cyrene.",是的！全熟恶魔，嘎嘣脆，由西兰尼的神圣之火烤就。
You don't seem too broken up about losing your adoptive father.,你似乎并没有因为失去你的养父而伤心欲绝。
"...\| It feels bizarre to even hear those words. That man, that being, took me in for his own designs.\! No one fiddles with the likes of Beatrix, not even you, \n[8]!",……\|我甚至连听到这些话都感觉很奇怪。那个人，那个存在，为了他自己的谋划才收留了我。\!没有人能摆弄跟碧翠丝一样的人，哪怕是你，\n[8]！
"Ha, duely noted.",哈，我晓得了。
"Now then. You've promised me a new adventure.\| Care to share the details, or shall I simply annihilate anything that looks in your direction?",接着说。你对我许诺过一场全新的冒险。\|你是愿意把细节拿出来说说呢，还是说我就应该把所有盯着你看的东西都烧成灰？
"Zanatus's dying words still haunt me. I felt no deception in those words. Zanatus's hatred for Donar, and for me, cannot be described.\! He felt a certain peace in his final moments. As though he'd finished his job.\! We have reports that some of the Followers of Zanatus went into exile, far to the East, bound for Grothnor of all places.",扎纳图斯临死前的话语至今仍在我耳边挥之不去。我不觉得那是谎言。扎纳图斯对多纳尔和我恨之入骨。\!但他在临终之时，却有种难言的平静。仿佛终于完成了自己的使命一般。\!我们有报告说，一些扎纳图斯的追随者已经流亡到遥远的东方，前往名为葛索诺的那片土地。
"Grothnor, hmm?\| You know, they say even Donar's light fails to reach its innermost depths.\! It is home to unspeakable horrors that could render a man insane from fear.\! An odd vacation destination, though you've successfully intrigued me.\! The treasures that await must be positively gleaming.",葛索诺，嗯哼？\|你知道的，据说就连多纳尔的光芒也无法触及葛索诺的最深处。\!那是无言恐惧的源泉，能让人在极大的恐怖中陷入疯狂。\!虽然你已经成功地引起了我的兴趣，但这可真是个奇怪的度假场所。\!不过那里肯定有闪闪发光的宝藏在等着我们！
"Yeah, I know. I couldn't imagine someone better equipped to be by my side for this.\| Ready to head off, then?",是的，我知道。我想象不出还有谁能比你更胜任和我一起前去。\|准备好出发了吗？
"Off we go, then! Let us set the future ablaze, \n[8]!",那么，开场喽！给未来加上点儿盛大的焰火吧，\n[8]！
