ENGLISH,ZH-cn
...Am I bothering you?,……我有打扰到你吗？
"Never.\! Join me, \n[8].",从来没有。\!过来吧，\n[8]。
Do you believe these people are common thugs?,你觉得这些人是普通暴民吗？
What I believe doesn't matter. We're just soldiers right now.,我的想法无关紧要。我们现在只是大头兵。
"Come on, I know you better than that. What exactly do you think the rebels want?",拜托，我知道你的思虑比这要深刻的多。你觉得那些叛军到底图什么？
"They don't know what they want. They're angry and confused. Lashing out against order, hoping chaos will improve their situation.\! All they understand is force, so force they shall receive.",他们都不知道自己想要什么。他们怒气冲天却又晕头转向。以为搅乱秩序，混乱的时局就能改善他们的处境。\!他们只懂诉诸暴力，所以反被暴力压制。
Interesting...,有趣……
"What do you think they want, then?",那你呢，你觉得他们想要什么？
"They just want to be heard and understood. The Empire's taxing people to death to pay for the Succession War debts.\! If we destroy Antares, others like him will continue to speak out and rebel.",他们只是想被聆听和理解。为了偿还继位战争的欠债，帝国在敲骨吸髓般的收税。\!就算我们讨伐了安塔瑞斯，其余和他一样的人也会继续反抗发声。
"You know just as I do - an army of lambs can become lions at a moment's notice. Let's not pretend that compassion will ever result in a lasting peace.\! If the roles were reversed, if you were the one begging for mercy, do you think you would get it?",我们心里都清楚，“狗急跳墙、兔急咬人”。别指望这些恻隐之心能带来什么长久的和平。\!如果身份互换，假设那个乞求仁慈的是你，你觉得你能求得到吗？
"And so, we follow orders, as it is our duty. Makes everything so simple.",所以说，我们服从命令，这是我们的职责。职责所在，这让一切变得如此简单。
There's a crimson star out tonight. Haven't seen one in a long time...,今晚天上挂着一颗猩红之星。很长时间都没见过了……
It is quite a sight to behold...,这是相当值得一看的景象……
It's an omen.,它是一种预兆。
Of course it is...,那当然……
"Every time we have seen the crimson star, something big happens. Really big. Changes the course of history.\! Think that star is speaking to us, \n[8]? Calling upon us to do as Donar would and fix this world?",猩红星现，大事将生。绝对的大事。会改变历史的那种。\!你觉得那颗星会在跟我们说话吗，\n[8]？号召我们像多纳尔一样修正这个世界？
Ugh...\| It's just...,呃……\|这也……
Yeah... sure. That's probably what it is.,哎……没错。说不定就是这样。
"Heh... \| Thank you for humoring me, \n[8].",哈……\|谢谢你的迁就，\n[8]。
