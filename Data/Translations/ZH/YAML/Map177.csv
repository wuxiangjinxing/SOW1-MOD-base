The Temple will confirm me, and then no one will question my rule.",我随时都可以坐在那里。\!但我不敢……\!对你们这些人来说，这把椅子不算什么。\!但对我来说……这是我的全部。\!圣殿会认同我，在这之后，没有人会质疑我的统治。

And now, I've had just about enough of justifying myself to you people. Off with you!",你有什么好担心的？\!莱森德将军，我们最优秀的战术家之一，会统帅军队。\!再加上枪兵队。\!好了，我已经受够了不停地向你们解释。滚吧！
