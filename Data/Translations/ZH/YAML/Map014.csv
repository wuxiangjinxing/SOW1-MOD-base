Chapter 10: To War,第10章：直面战争
"This is the great Duchy of Isanter?\! Our greatest rival for generations?\! What a joke.\! Commander, send all units to their capital at once!",这就是伟大的伊桑特公国？\!我们几代人的宿敌？\!真是可笑。\!指挥官，传令全军向敌首都进发！
"Diana, is the Temple prepared to go to war against Rimorgue?",戴安娜，圣殿准备好跟里莫格开战了吗？
This war is upon us whether we are prepared or not.\! Isanter is the only thing standing between us and ruin.\! We must not let their capital fall.,无论是否准备好，敌人都已经兵临城下了。\!伊桑特是我们与灭亡之间的唯一屏障。\!我们绝不能让他们的首都陷落。
"Got it.\! We need to push south and waste no time while we're at it.\! If we can retake Trucea from the Eastern armies, all the better.",明白。\!我们需要争分夺秒地向南推进。\!如果我们能从东方军队手中夺回特鲁恰，那就更好了。
"Hello again, blue-haired human.",又见面了，蓝发人类。
Uh oh.\! I hope you haven't found a job with the Rimorgue Army...,呃哦。\!希望你还没在里莫格军队里找到工作……
"Raskuja did makings an offer to the one called Terenor, but Raskuja did not care for that one's personality.\! The blue-haired human is to be being more favorable to be conversing with.",拉斯库亚确实跟名叫特瑞诺的人类接触过，但拉斯库亚对那个人类并不感冒。\!蓝发人类比那家伙好相处。
"Oh... well, thanks!",哦……嗯，谢了！
"Raskuja offers his services to the blue-haired human free of charge.\! But he is to be expecting much reward when human civil war comes to its end.\! If blue-haired human refuses, it would be to be having much foolishness.",拉斯库亚会免费为蓝发人类提供服务。\!但当人类的内战结束时，他会期待得到很多很多。\!如果蓝发人类拒绝的话，那可就太愚蠢了。
"Can't argue with that, cat.\! You've got yourself a deal!\! If you're as good as you say, I'm sure Duke Lothair will make it worth your trouble.\! Blue-haired human's name is to be being \n[8].",你说得对，大猫。\!成交！\!如果你真像你说的那么厉害，我相信洛泰尔公爵会为此买单的。\!蓝发人类的名字是\n[8]。
"\n[8] shows great wisdom.\! Humans watch, you are to be learning what elite Barek Tor mercenary can do.",\n[8]彰显出了绝大的智慧。\!看好了，人类，你们将领会到精锐兽人佣兵的风采。
