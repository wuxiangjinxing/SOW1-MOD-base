"\c[1]The Avatar of Donar's army is victorious today. The catastrophe has been avoided, the brood continuity of my kin is protected.","\c[1]多纳尔化身的军队胜利了。灾难得以避免，我亲族的血脉也因此得以延续。"
"Those boys were no joke. I've never seen the Archaelus armies fight with such fervor. What gives, dragon?",那些敌人蛮有实力啊。我从未见过斗志如此昂扬的阿开勒斯军。这是怎么回事，巨龙？
"\c[1]Brief is the timeline of a human's life. Not brief is mine. Also not brief is the timeline of the forces arrayed against the Avatar of Donar.\! Ageless, is the dark one. The one not of the essence of Tahnra's creation.",\c[1]人类的一生很短暂。我的则很漫长。与多纳尔化身为敌的势力亦如是。\!而那个黑暗之物，是永恒的。对于塔恩拉来说，它是异物。
Zanatus.,扎纳图斯。
"\c[1]The one not of Tahnra bears an understanding beyond that which is possible within one mere timeline of the human.\! This empire named Archaelus, this army named Nephilim Army. Brief contrivances these are, to the dark one.\! To him, the mission is one that spans millennia. As long as his life. As my life.","\c[1]那个侵入塔恩拉之物有着远超人类穷尽一生所能企及的认知。\!无论是名为阿开勒斯的帝国，还是名为圣灵军的部队。对于那个黑暗之物来说，都不过是稍纵即逝的物件。\!对他来说，他的使命以千年计数。和它的寿命等长。和我的寿命等长。"
"Yeah, I think that's pretty clear at this point. So, what exactly is this mission of his, anyway? The one I keep getting told I couldn't possibly understand?","是啊，我觉得事到如今这是明摆着的。所以，他的使命到底是什么？就是那个所有知情方都众口一词地声称我绝对无法理解的那个?"
So...,那么……
"Dear Azuros, please trust \n[8] with your wisdom!",亲爱的阿祖罗斯，请将您的智慧托付与\n[8]吧！
"\c[1]Adorimetra, the Gold. Mother of all of my kin. Mother of Azuros.\! First born of Donar in all Tahnra. First to awaken, when the god of creation awakened this world.\! Just as the Avatar of Donar stands before Azuros, so too does Azuros live.\! The dark one is not a descendant of Adorimetra. Not a descendant of Donar. An infestation.\! The mission of the human's timeline is to destroy, or to impede Zanatus.\! To destroy his body, and followers, and most crucially, his words. Words he has infused within the language of the mortal beings of Tahnra. Words which will be the undoing of all things.\! Words whose nature lie beyond even the understanding of Azuros...",\c[1]黄金之阿朵莉美特拉。我族之母。也是阿祖罗斯之母。\!多纳尔在塔恩拉的初创之物。在创造之神将这个世界唤醒之时，她第一个醒来。\!就和站在阿祖罗斯面前的多纳尔化身一样，阿祖罗斯也是活物\!而那个黑暗之物，他不是阿朵莉美特拉的后裔。不是多纳尔的后裔。而是一种感染。\!人类的使命是摧毁，或至少妨碍扎纳图斯。\!摧毁他的身体、他的信众，以及最重要的，他的言语。他已经将自己的言语深深地融入到塔恩拉的凡夫俗子的语言之中。而这些言语将成为世界毁灭的原因\!这些言语的本质，甚至阿祖罗斯也无法参透……
"An infestation. Interesting choice of words, Azuros. Everything else has been about some overwhelming power of creation.\! You, me, Abigayle, the magic that brought me back... all living things, all elements of nature, even Casamir, perhaps. But the one outlier is Zanatus.\! Any insight into what exactly he is, then?",一种感染。措辞很有意思，阿祖罗斯。所有其他东西都和某种创世伟力有关\!你、我、阿比盖尔、让我死而复生的魔法……一切活物、一切基本元素，也许甚至还包括卡萨米尔。扎纳图斯是唯一的例外。\!那您有没有关于他的本质的洞见呢？
"I'm sorry, \n[8], this is all Dear Azuros knows. I feel a great regret within him. There is very little he doesn't know, thus the nature of Zanatus frustrates him greatly!",很抱歉，\n[8]，亲爱的阿祖罗斯只知道这些。我能从他身上感受到一种深切的遗憾。他几乎无所不知，所以扎纳图斯的本质这一问题令他十分懊丧！
\c[1]Abigayle.,\c[1]阿比盖尔。
"Yes, Dear Azuros?",什么事，亲爱的阿祖罗斯？
"\c[1]The one named ""Nibbler"" has found counsel in me. He cares for Abigayle greatly. The young dragon's request will be fulfilled.\! In times ancient, there was one called ""Queen of Dragons"". This title will now return to Tahnra.\! Queen of Dragons Abigayle. The power of dragonkind is now yours to wield.","\c[1]那条叫做""轻遥""的龙向我咨询了一个想法。他十分关心阿比盖尔。青年龙的请求将得到满足。\!古时，曾经有一个被称作“龙族之母”的头衔。现在，这一头衔将回归塔恩拉。\!龙族女王阿比盖尔。龙裔的力量现在任你驱使。"
Queen of Dragons...?,龙族女王……?
"It's a little on the nose if you ask me, but hey, might as well make it official.","要我说这名字有点直白，不过，得到官方确认也好。"
"\c[1]Abigayle can now become the ""Queen of Dragons"" unit, an incredibly powerful new type of Dragon Rider. Access this new class in the Class Change menu.","\c[1]阿比盖尔现在可以变成""龙族女王""单位，一种极其强大的新种类龙骑士。通过“变更职业”菜单获取。
