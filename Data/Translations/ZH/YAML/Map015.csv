Chapter 11: Taking Fort Eureeka,第11章：攻克尤里卡堡
"Bonanza! So many little toy soldiers on the battlefield, just for me.\! Very well, if my actions today will grease the wheels of power, so be it.",真是太棒了！战场上有这么多的玩具小兵供我娱乐。\!好吧，如果我今天的行动能为大业添砖加瓦的话，那就如此吧。
"\c[1]Just enough to stop their momentum, Beatrix!\! Don't kill everyone right now - we need more time to prepare for the next phase!",\c[1]只要堪堪挡住他们的军势就够啦，碧翠丝！\!别都杀光了，我们需要更多时间来为下个阶段做准备！
"Quiet, old man, I was born for this...\| It's time, my poor little soldiers... come to Beatrix!",闭嘴，老头子，我可是行家……\|是时候了，我可怜的小士兵们……来碧翠丝这儿吧！
"Th-that mage is some sort of demon!!\! Men of Isanter, full retreat!!",那……那法师简直是恶魔啊！！\!伊桑特的战士听令，全员撤退！！
...How dare you? Did I order you to retreat?\! I am not bored with slaughtering you yet!,……你怎么敢？我让你们撤退了吗？\!我还没杀够呢！
Damn. We're on our own out here.\! If you want something done right...,见鬼。只剩下我们了。\!如果真想做点事情……
"That enemy sorceress singlehandedly decimated Isanter's most elite forces...\! Unless you've got something up your sleeve, \n[8], I pray you find a way to avoid sending our troops anywhere near her.",敌军那个女术士一手摧毁了伊桑特最精锐的部队……\!\n[8]，除非你有什么秘密武器，否则请千万别把我们的部队往她附近送。
Noted. Let's see how this shakes out.,知道了。让我们看看事态会如何收场。
"My gracious... these ones are feisty.\! Oh well, I've had my fill.\! Have fun playing war, darlings.",我的老天……这些人可真好斗。\!好吧，我已经玩够了。\!亲爱的们，祝你们在战场上玩得开心。
"If we don't see her again, it'll be too soon.",我真是再也不想见到她了，永不。
"Sigh... what a bore, these temple types.\! But I do think I've sent enough of them to the void for today.\! Have fun playing war, darlings! Nap time for Beatrix.",（叹气）哎……这些圣殿的人真无聊。\!但我觉得今天确实已经干掉他们足够多的人了。\!亲爱的们，祝你们在战场上玩得开心！碧翠丝该去睡午觉了。
