"So, you've resolved to exile yourself?",所以说，你是要放逐你自己吗？
"My role in the Millennium War is over. Zanatus is finally dead.\! I came close to losing myself completely, Diana. I can't face the people of Armitage again...\| not for a while.",我在千年战争中的使命结束了。扎纳图斯终于死了。\!我差点完全迷失了自我，戴安娜。我无颜面对阿米塔吉的人民……\|至少短时间内不行。
"To face your own demons... it can be the greatest struggle.\! But the people of Veridia have been fully liberated by you, and will welcome your return, I'm certain of it.",面对自己的心魔……它或许会是人最大的挑战。\!但你彻底解放了维尔迪亚的人民，我确信他们会欢迎你的回归。
"You're probably right. But outside of that, I feel compelled by a call to the east.\| Zanatus's dying words still haunt me.",也许吧。可除此之外，我还感受到了来自东方的呼唤。\|扎纳图斯临死前的话语至今仍在我耳边挥之不去。
"Accursed demon, still weaving chaos from beyond the void.",可憎的恶魔，仍在虚无中编织混乱。
"He may be a manipulator, but I felt no deception in those words. Zanatus's hatred for Donar, and for me, cannot be described.\! He felt a certain peace in his final moments. As though he'd finished his job.\! We have reports that some of the Followers of Zanatus went into exile, far to the East, bound for Grothnor of all places.",他或许真的喜欢玩弄人心，但我觉得那些话不是谎言。扎纳图斯对多纳尔和我恨之入骨。\!但他在临终之时，却有种难言的平静。仿佛终于完成了自己的使命一般。\!我们有报告说，一些扎纳图斯的追随者已经流亡到遥远的东方，前往名为葛索诺的那片土地。
"The existence of Grothnor, the land untouched by Donar's light, has haunted me for some time as well.\| Legends tell that Zanatus emerged from that place.\! I will enjoy crushing what ever abominations dare threaten you there.",葛索诺的存在，那片连多纳尔的光芒都未触及之地，也困扰我有些时日了。\|传说中扎纳图斯就出身于此。\!我会碾碎一切敢于伤害你的可憎之物，并好好享受这滋味的。
"Sheesh, no rest for the wicked with you around, huh?\| And... no rest for you either?\! What about Alex, and the Temple?",哇哦，有你傍身，可止恶人夜啼，是吧？\|而且……你这样不会整得自己也不得安宁吗？\!艾利克斯和圣殿怎么办？
"The Temple is at peace, and my son is strong.\| It was not difficult to refuse the role of Grandmaster.\! I have been lent the power to destroy evil by the gods, and until such time as I rejoin them in the divine realm, this gift shall be used to its fullest.\! And to you, my oath remains... no foe of yours will remain safe, so long as I live and breathe.",圣殿一切太平，他也健壮无虞。\|推掉圣宗的职位没那么难。\!众神赋予了我消灭邪恶的力量，在重归神界之前，我会好好利用这份礼物。\!并且对于你，我的誓言依然有效……只要我一息尚存，你的敌人就别想安生。
"Yeah, I look forward to your bad guy flattening in the coming days.\| Hey, speaking of which, why are you still in your, uh... shrunken state?",是啊，我可盼着接下来能看你把碍事的坏蛋们都整趴下的日子呢！\|咦，说起来，你怎么还是这个，呃…………缩小的状态？
"I am...\| still adjusting. My instinct tells me to remain in this state, so as not to alarm others.",我……\|还在适应。我的直觉告诉我要保持这种状态，免得吓到别人。
"Trust when I say, I am not alarmed.\| Come on, do the big lady thing.\| And please don't hold back, I'd very much enjoy riding on your shoulders.",安啦，我才不会被吓到呢。\|来嘛，快变成大块头女士。\|并且请不要有所保留，我可是很乐意骑在你的肩膀上呢。
"\n[8], even you can be shameless.\| But very well, I shall give the Avatar of Donar what's desired and fill this world with my form. Stand clear...",\n[8]，连你都开始不要脸了。\|不过很好，我是应该让多纳尔的化身得偿所愿，让我的身形充满整个世界。站远点……
