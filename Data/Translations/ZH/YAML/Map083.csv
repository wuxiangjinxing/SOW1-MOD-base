Well... yes...\| They say other things as well.\! But I am curious about the boastful part.,嗯…确实…\|他们也说了其他事情。\!但我对夸夸其谈的部分很好奇。
What?\| Why?,什么？\|为什么是这部分？
"It's okay, I don't mind.\! Please tell me about some of your great exploits.",没事啦，我不介意的。\!告诉我一些你的伟大事迹啦。
"Let's see if there's anything that won't disgust you...\! Ah, the conquest of Stormrook was a high point in the campaign.\! The holdouts loyal to the Duchy of Rimorgue took their last stand...",让咱们看看有没有什么不会让你反感的…\!啊，征服风鸦堡是一个高光时刻呢。\!忠于里莫格公国的顽固分子进行了最后的抵抗…
"Please dear Zelos, nothing like that.\! I want to hear about you! And your great abilities and victories...",拜托，亲爱的泽洛斯，不要这样啦。\!我想听听你的故事！还有你的那些威武的能力和伟大胜利……

"You know what's interesting?\! Back when I was a ""nice"" guy, women did not care for me much.\! Yeah, they thought I was handsome, but whatever.\! Now, here we are, with you swooning over tales of conquest.\! It's all about the bad boys, isn't it?",你知道有趣的点是什么吗？\!我之前当“好人”的时候，没哪个女的正眼瞧我。\!是，她们是觉得我长得帅，但那又能如何。\!现在，我们走到了这一步，还附赠你这一个沉浸在征服故事里的小迷妹。\!男人不坏女人不爱，是吧？
"It's not like that!\! I'm so sorry to have offended you, dear Zelos...",不是那样的！\!真对不起，我又跟你杠了，亲爱的泽洛斯…
