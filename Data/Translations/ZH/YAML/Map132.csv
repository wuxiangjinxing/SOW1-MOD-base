Hey \n[8]...\| are you sure you've forgiven me?,嘿\n[8]……\|你确定你已经原谅我了吗？
"Hmmmm, maybe.",嗯，也许吧。
...Oh.,……噢。
"Heh, sorry. I figured that was obvious.\| Just... try not to listen to Lysander's honeyed words for a while, huh?",哈，抱歉。我以为这是明摆着的。\|只要……以后很长一段时间都别再听信口蜜腹剑的莱森德了，好吧？
"Of course, \n[8]...\| I will be by your side for the rest of my days, with all of my heart, I swear it!\! So, we must leave Veridia? Your mind is made up?",当然，\n[8]……\|在余下的日子里，我会全心全意陪在你身边的，我发誓！\!所以，我们必须离开维尔迪亚吗？你下定决心了吗？
"My role in the Millennium War is over. Zanatus is finally dead.\! I came close to losing myself completely, Abi. I can't face the people of Armitage again...\| not for a while.",我在千年战争中的使命结束了。扎纳图斯终于死了。\!我差点完全迷失了自我，阿比。我无颜面对阿米塔吉的人民……\|至少短时间内不行。
"I understand. If they will not have you, then they will not have me just the same.\! What lies ahead for us, \n[8]?",我明白。如果他们不接纳你，那我也不去。\!前方又有什么在等着我们呢，\n[8]？
"Zanatus's dying words still haunt me. I felt no deception in those words. Zanatus's hatred for Donar, and for me, cannot be described.\! He felt a certain peace in his final moments. As though he'd finished his job.\! We have reports that some of the Followers of Zanatus went into exile, far to the East, bound for Grothnor of all places.",扎纳图斯临死前的话语至今仍在我耳边挥之不去。我不觉得那是谎言。扎纳图斯对多纳尔和我恨之入骨。\!但他在临终之时，却有种难言的平静。仿佛终于完成了自己的使命一般。\!我们接到报告说，一些扎纳图斯的追随者已经流亡去了遥远的东方，前往名为葛索诺的土地。
Grothnor? I've never heard of this place!,葛索诺？我从没听说过这个地方！
"A frozen hellscape far to the east in the unexplored continent.\| They say Zanatus himself emerged from a bottomless pit in the heart of Grothnor, though these are likely tall tales.",那是人迹罕至，充满未知的极寒冰狱。\|据说扎纳图斯自己就是从葛索诺的无底深渊中诞生的，尽管这些有可能只是夸张的故事。
Sounds dreadful.,好吓人哎。
"We will see.\| So you're willing to leave behind your dragons?","到时候就知道了。\|所以你愿意向你的龙群告别吗？"
!!!\| I wouldn't dream of it! That is why we will be using Nibbler as our primary means of transport.\! Did you expect anything different?,！！！\|我才不想呢！这就是我们要用轻遥来做主要交通工具的原因。\!你想试试别的？
"Haha, I suppose not.\| I just hope I don't have to compete for your attention.",哈哈，不会的啦。\|我只希望到时别沦落到要和一个交通工具争你的宠就好。
"Hey, Abi...\| thank you for coming into my life. I couldn't imagine walking this journey without you.",嘿，阿比……\|谢谢你走进我的生活。我无法想象没有你这趟旅程会是怎样。
"We are so blessed that Donar allowed us to cross paths, \n[8]!\| Let us see if we can seek him out and thank him ourselves...",多纳尔让我们相遇可真是天大的幸运，\n[8]！\|让我们看看能不能找到祂，亲身表达一下感谢……
