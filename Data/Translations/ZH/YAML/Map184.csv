And if they get their hands on these weapons...?,如果他们拿到这些武器的话……？
"Then you'll be in a bind, won't you?",你就会陷入大麻烦，不是吗？
Beatrix...\| How exactly do you know all this?,碧翠丝……\|你到底是怎么知道这一切的？
"I had a feeling you'd ask, so full of curiosity, this one.\! I take it you've become acquainted with the Followers of Zanatus, hmm?",我就感觉你会问这个问题，好奇心很重啊，你这人。\!我想你已经熟悉扎纳图斯的信徒了吧？
We have.,没错。
"Oh, I know.\! You are a real thorn in their side, Avatar of Donar.\! Or, as they would say, the ""False One.""\! Once they found out I'm one of the Nephilim, they tried to make me one of them.\! Odd, I'd figure they would prefer just to kill me off.\! That's what happens when you fly too close to the sun, you get burnt, and I burned them quite handily.\! Stole all the secrets I could, and left to find my destiny, the magic of Cyrene.",噢，我知道。\!多纳尔的化身，你可是他们的眼中钉啊。\!或者，按他们的说法：“伪灵”。\!当他们发现我是圣灵一员之后，他们想要我加入他们。\!太奇怪了，我还以为他们会更愿意杀了我。\!飞的太靠近太阳就会被灼伤，反正我是很容易就把他们烧了。\!我偷走了所有能偷到的秘密，然后离开去寻找我的命运，西兰尼的魔法。
"...And here you are, falling into our lap.\! Seems a bit convenient for my tastes.",……然后你就在这，给我们撞了个正着。\!我觉得有点太过容易了。
"We live in a time of fate, darling.\! Is it so hard to believe that we Nephilim would find each other?",亲爱的，我们生活在一个被命运支配的时代。\!相信我们圣灵会找到彼此有这么难吗？
"Either way, you're Nephilim, and we fight together.\! ...Just don't disappoint us, Beatrix.\! You've gotta admit, we did not get off on the right foot.",不管怎样，你也是圣灵，我们要一起战斗。\!……别让我们失望，碧翠丝。\!你必须承认，我们初识的情形并不好。
"Oh pish... bygones and all that.\! I do wonder, what besides favor with the heavens do I have to gain by lending you my considerable power?",哦得了吧……都已经过去了。\!我很想知道，将我强大的力量借给你后，除了得到上天的眷顾，我还能得到什么？
"All I can offer you is a target-rich environment.\! And that's my final offer, and don't pretend that's not exactly what you want.",我只能给你提供一个充满目标的环境。\!而这是我的最终报价，别装成一副你不想要的样子。
"Touche, Avatar of Donar!",一针见血啊，多纳尔的化身！
