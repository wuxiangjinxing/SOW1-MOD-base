"Well met, Duke Jaromir.\! I can't tell you how grateful I am that we crossed paths, to quickly become allies like this.\! It's the perfect place to build up a power base - far from Casamir's core armies.",很高兴见到你，贾洛米公爵。\!我们相遇，结盟，迅速而又自然。我无法用言语表达我是有多么感激。\!这里远离卡萨米尔的核心军队，是建立基地的完美场所。
"You honor me, Avatar of Donar.\! That my name and the people of Embor will be foundational in this new holy war - I never dreamed of being given the opportunity to pursue glory such as this.\! It is worth sacrificing everything... my lands, and my life.",多纳尔的化身，您过誉了。\!我的旗帜的恩博尔人民将成为这场新圣战的坚实后盾——我从未想过有机会追求这样的荣耀。\!牺牲一切都是值得的……我的土地，还有我的生命。
"Let's not be sacrificing anything yet, friend.\! Hey, can you tell me a little about the Duchy of Embor?\! We Southerners only ever hear about it as some distant, cold, lonely place, heh.",咱们先别忙着聊牺牲的事儿哈，朋友。\!嘿，你能跟我说一些恩博尔公国的事吗？\!我们南方人只听说它是一个遥远、寒冷、孤独的地方，哎。
"Cold and distant to you indeed.\! But that is part of what defines us Emborians. The Northern plains are vast and unforgiving.\! For centuries, Embor has acted as Veridia's bulwark to the North and East, just as Stormrook protects its South, and the Herald Sea protects its West.",对您来说确实又冷又远。\!但这也铸就了我们恩博尔人。北方平原辽阔且无情。\!几个世纪以来，恩博尔一直是维尔迪亚面向北方和东方的壁垒，就像风鸦堡守护它的南面，而先驱海保护它的西面一样。
"Yeah, your troops seem to brush off the cold like it's nothing.\! That's impressive - I'm sure most of Casamir's men aren't so resilient, which in part explains why their presence was so weak here.",是的，您的部队似乎视寒冷为无物。\!这真让人印象深刻——我敢肯定卡萨米尔的大部分手下都没那么有韧性，这也在一定程度上解释了为什么他们在这里的存在感如此微弱。
"For that, we are fortunate. For we Emborians are few in number.\! Our lands are not as bountiful as the green valleys of Rimorgue.\! So easily the Southerners have forgotten their roots - Embor was the first settlement in Veridia.",从这方面讲，我们很幸运。因为我们恩博尔人数目稀少。\!我们的土地不如里莫格苍翠的溪谷那么肥沃。\!南方人很轻易就忘记了他们的根——恩博尔是维尔迪亚的第一个定居点。
Oh yeah?\! Wouldn't have guessed!,哇，是吗？\!真的想不到！
"Yes. Ancient Donari texts tell of a great migration, escaping from Zanatus's power, from the East... the vast frozen landscape of Grothnor.\! When our ancestors arrived in Felnamia and later Embor, we finally were able to forge a home for ourselves to prepare for the coming reckoning with Zanatus.\! Not unlike what we are living here, today.\! And just the same, the demon will suffer ultimate defeat by your very hands.",是的。古多纳尔教文献记载了一场大规模的迁徙，人们从东方试图逃离扎纳图斯的魔掌……那广袤无垠的葛索诺冰原。\!当我们的祖先到达费纳米亚，然后又进一步抵达恩博尔时，我们终于能够为自己缔造一个家园，为将来向扎纳图斯反击积蓄力量。\!和现下的恩博尔有不少相似之处。\!而就和过去一样，恶魔也必将被您亲手终结。
"Ummmm, well yes! Let's hope!\! Gonna need all the help I can get with that one, I'm sure...",嗯……啊是的没错！让我们拭目以待吧！\!为此我需要我所能得到的一切助力，我很确定……
