They say you have decided not to take the title of Grandmistress of the Temple... but why? Who better to serve in this role?,他们说你已经决定不接受圣殿女圣宗的头衔了……可为什么啊？又有谁更适合担任这个角色呢？

"Diana, I just wanted to see if now'd be a good time to make my induction into the Sisterhood of Justice official!\!

Heh. Fair enough.,呃。你赢了。
"Ah, you'd just like to make it formal.\! To be honest, I'd forgotten all about that. To me, your induction into the sacred order was official then and there.\! But, after your decision to follow Lysander, I still want to see you mature a bit, not to fall so easily to suggestion. You must be your own person.\! ...\|One year of satisfactory service to the Temple, then you will reach the first rank within the Sisterhood of Justice.\! That's the best I can do, and I believe you have what it takes.",啊，你只是想让它得到官方确认。\!老实说，我都忘记了。对我来说，在那时那刻你就已经正式加入了神圣教团。\!但是，在你决定加入莱森德之后，我还是希望看到你成熟一点，不再轻易遭受蛊惑。你必须做自己的主宰。\!……\|在圣殿里好好做满一年，然后你就能进入正义修女会的初级序列了。\!我最多只能帮你到这里了，我相信你有能力做好。

"...Given the circumstances, perhaps another chance is warranted.\! I do not blame you for what you must feel is a betrayal. You could not ignore your instincts.\! But this will be the second Temple induction chance for you, which is highly unusual...\! One year of satisfactory service, then you will be granted the first rank within the Sisterhood of Mercy.\! That's the best I can do, and I believe you have what it takes.",……综合考虑下来，或许应该再给你一次机会。\!我不会责怪你，你当时一定能意识到自己的行为是背叛。你不是那种能忽视本性的人。\!但这会是你第二次进入圣殿，是很特殊的案例……\!一年考核达标，然后你就进入慈悲修女会的初级序列了。\!我最多只能帮你到这里了，我相信你有能力做好。

But if you need me, I'll be there.",\n[8]……\|我们进入了未知的世界。\!随着黑暗之神的终结，塔恩拉的人们再次拥有了做出巨大变革的力量，无论是为了行善还是做恶。\!我不知道你将会面对什么。但如果你需要我，我定当效劳。
