ENGLISH,ZH-cn
"By Donar, if I survive this heat, I shall never forsake the tundra again as long as I shall live!",多纳尔在上，如果这回我能挺过这高温，有生之年我将再也不离开苔原了！
Perhaps your kind would do well to listen to your body. That is Donar telling you not to be where you don't belong.,或许你这种人应该好好听从身体的发出劝告。那是多纳尔在告诫你，不要去不适合你的地方。
"Perhaps it is, Sayunaari.\! But for the return of Donar, no amount of suffering would dissuade me from this great holy war.",也许是吧，萨育纳人。\!但为了多纳尔的回归，再多的苦难也无法阻止我参加这场伟大的圣战。
"...I believe you.\! That is no small feat, Veridian.",……我相信你。\!这并不容易，维尔迪亚人。
"Ha ha ha, then I will have accomplished something this day, even if the desert takes me.",哈哈哈，那我这一天也算是有所成就，哪怕沙漠把我吞了也无憾了。
"Ahhh, of course. You're a Highlander, aren't you, Jaromir?",啊哈，当然。你是高地人，对吧，贾洛米？
"That is... an ancient distinction.\! I am a servant of Donar first, and a Veridian second.\! The people of my Duchy do indeed trace their roots to the Felnamia Highlanders.\! Centuries of integration has all but erased that part of our past.",那是……一个很古老的称呼了。\!我首先是多纳尔的仆人，其次是维尔迪亚人。\!我公国的人民确实可以追溯到费纳米亚高地人。\!但数个世纪的融合几乎抹去了我们的那一部分过去。
"I see.\! Regardless, you are the Shield of the North, the iron wall behind which the Midlanders sleep soundly.\! Just as they do due to the existence of my nation - a Shield against the endless wastes to the East.\! Tell me, Highlander, what do you think would happen to the Midlanders if our two peoples' did not exist?",我明白了。\!无论如何，你都是北方的坚盾，是让中土地区的人们得以安然入睡的铜墙铁壁。\!我的国家也是他们得以安睡的原因——我们是替他们抵御东方荒芜之地的壁垒。\!告诉我，高地人，没了咱们两族，你认为中土人会怎样？
"Crumble to dust at the first instance of difficulty, no doubt.",在困难面前一触即溃，毫无疑问。
"Ha ha ha... even if you humor me, it is needed at this time.\! Thank you for your fellowship, Highlander.\! May the bulwarks of the snow and of the sand never perish.",哈哈哈…哪怕你只是在迎合我，这种时候我也确实需要。\!感谢你的友谊，高地人。\!愿雪与沙的壁垒屹立不倒。
