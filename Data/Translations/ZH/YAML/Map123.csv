Beatrix... I have so much to ask you.,碧翠丝……我有很多事要问你。
"\n[8]... please, ask away.\! I'll talk as long as I'm not bored.\! It helps that you are pretty. Don't let anyone tell you that being pretty isn't important!",\n[8]……别这样，请说。\!只要不无聊，我就会一直讲下去。\!也是你蛮俊俏的，我才愿意说。所以相貌真的很重要！
"You're of the Pendergast family?\! As in, Edmund Pendergast? Richest person alive?",你是潘德加斯特家族的吗？\!就是埃德蒙·潘德加斯特的家族？那个世界首富？
"Yes indeed, the very same.",是的，确实如此。
You must stand to inherit untold riches.,你将来要继承的遗产肯定难以计数。
"Well, I do deserve all the world's riches...\| but that doesn't mean the old man's going to bequeath his fortune solely to me.\! He's got an army of sycophants looking to take a bite out of his empire at all times.\! Guess we'll see when that cold, ancient heart of his finally gives out.",嗯，我确实配得上世界上所有的财富……\|可这并不意味着那老头会把他的财产全部留给我。\!有一大群马屁精时刻想从他的商业帝国中分一杯羹。\!我猜只能等他那颗古老且冰冷的心脏终于停跳时再说了。
"...Not the closest with your father, huh?",……看来你和你父亲不是特别亲啊？
"Oh really?\! What ever gave it away?? Ha!\! No, maybe someday I'll tell you why.",噢，是吗？\!我是怎么露馅的？？哈！\!确实不亲近，也许有一天我会告诉你原因。
No worries. I'm wondering how Pendergast came into his wealth.\! Almost seems unfair.,不要紧。我想知道潘德加斯特是怎么发财的。\!看起来很不公平。
"When the lion slays the gazelle, would you rather lament the unfairness of nature, or try to become the lion?\! You know anything about the Aetherium Crisis?",当狮子杀死瞪羚时，你要感叹大自然的不公，还是努力成为狮子？\!你知道以太危机吗？
"I like to say I'm a history nerd, so yes.",我自认是个历史迷，所以我是知道的。
"Well, well, poindexter, you're in for a treat.\! Pendergast has always been around, but once the world got a nice facelift from the destruction caused by the Aetherium Crisis, Pendergast was there to buy up all the cheapened real estate.\! That, and they financed the reconstruction efforts from shore to shore.\! That sort of thing pays off, big time.\! 'Tis the banker who rules the world, without swinging a sword.\! Wait a few generations, invest the earnings, and now they control whoever they can buy.\! You know, that does sound pretty unfair, now that you mention it.",好啊，好啊，那我接下来要讲的东西你这个书呆子肯定会喜欢。\!尽管潘德加斯特家族一直都在，但是以太危机给世界地形造成的巨变给了我们买下所有变廉价的房产的机会。\!而且，从西岸到南岸的所有重建工作都有他们提供贷款。\!这种事情当然会得到回报，很大的那种。\!银行家才是世界的统治者，而他们甚至都不用舞刀弄枪。\!几代人的时间里不断用收益进行新的投资，现在他们可以用钞能力搞定任何人。\!你知道，被你这么一提，这听起来确实相当不公平。
"So in lieu of you inheriting this fortune, what exactly has lead you down this path?",那么，不是因为你要继承这笔财富，又究竟是什么让你走上了这条路呢？
...And what path would that be?,……你说的是什么路呢？
I guess I don't know that one either.,我想我也不知道。
"I will confess... I sometimes feel like an alien living among humans.\! Your customs and earthly pleasures bore me.\! What really gets me going is seeing what kind of disruption I can weave.\! Right now, that puts me on your side.\! But later, if I should develop the means, I'm not sure! I could just become your greatest adversary, if doing so is entertaining to me.\! ...Does that make you nervous?",坦白地说……有时我觉得自己是生活在人类当中的外星人。\!你们的习俗和世俗的乐趣让我厌烦。\!真正让我兴奋的是弄清楚我可以造成什么样的破坏。\!现在，正是这一点让我站在了你这边。\!不过以后我就不敢肯定了！如果这样做对我来说很有趣的话，我可能会成为你最大的对手。\!……你会为此紧张吗？
"Yep, a little.\! But I'm a better judge of character than you think.\! If I truly felt that you would bring us down, I'd let you know.\! But I don't feel that way.",是的，有一点。\!但我比你想象的更能判断人品。\!我要是真觉得你会给我们带来灾难的话，我会让你知道的。\!但我没有感受到这种威胁。
Awww... so trusting. Easier to devour when I'm good and ready.,噢……你太轻信了。当我准备好时像你这样的更好收拾。
"Beatrix, you are a character.",碧翠丝，你真有趣。
"And you have successfully entertained me, but I can already feel boredom creeping in.\! Do be a dear and visit me some other time, mmm?",而你成功地取悦了我，但我已经开始感到无聊了。\!做个小乖乖，改天来找我呗？
Of course. Enjoy!,那当然。祝好！
