"You lovelies found me at the shrine in pursuit of my divine weapon.\! You see, as the legend goes, the original Nephilim sealed away their weapons after defeating Zanatus, and spread them throughout the world.\! Then the Temple decided, like many things, to keep this a secret.\! No need to fuss - you're in for a treat. Heard about your little divine intervention on Mount Ptolomea. Well... you haven't yet tasted power!\! These weapons will unlock every bit of your potential.",你们这些小可爱撞见了正在神殿里找自己的神圣武器的我。\!你们看，和传说一样，最初的圣灵在击败扎纳图斯后封印了他们的武器，并将其分散到世界各地。\!然后圣殿决定把这件事和其他事情一起保密。\!不用担心——我有好消息。我听说了你在托洛米亚山略微施展了神力的事。不过……你还没有尝过真正的力量！\!这些武器将释放你的每一份潜力。
"There's the magic of Cyrene, at Mount Karnac...",卡纳克山有西兰尼的魔法……
"Balmung, the divine greatsword of Ishtar, at Sandraka City...",桑德拉卡城有伊什塔尔的神剑巴尔蒙克……
"Valor, the gauntlet of Galzus at Greywind Peak, belonging to our Paladin of prolific proportions here...",盖泽斯的旧日灵装，勇气护手在灰风山上，属于我们这位身材饱满的圣骑士……
"Skyrender, underneath the royal Palace at Sayunaa.\! Oh, I suppose the heavens have chosen the poorly-dressed rogue to carry this torch, eh?\! Congratulations.",圣器裂空则位于萨育纳皇宫下方。\!噢，我想上天是选择了这位缺乏衣品的无赖来举起这把武器的吧？\!恭喜。
'Least I'm decently clothed...,至少我衣物遮体……
"Last and certainly not least, Lightfury, the sword of Donar, which dealt the final blow to Zanatus, piercing the demon's heart.\! Of course, this one's at the Imperial capital.\! We know this one belongs in your hands, \n[8].\! You holding Lightfury would be the closest any of us mere mortals can get to sitting down and having tea with Donar himself.",最重要的是多纳尔的宝剑，光明之怒，它给了扎纳图斯最后一击，刺穿了他的心脏。\!当然，它现在被存放在皇宫。\!我们知道它属于你，\n[8]。\!你手握光明之怒的时候，与多纳尔之间的联系会亲近到凡人可及的极限。
"Two are already found.\! Mine, and the Balmung, wielded by the black knight you darlings refer to as the Hand of Zanatus.\! But three are still ripe for the picking.",我们已经找到了两件武器。\!我自己的，以及巴尔蒙克，目前在由你们这群小可爱称为扎纳图斯之手的黑骑士使用。\!但是还有三件武器未找到。
