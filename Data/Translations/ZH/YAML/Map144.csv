This can't be real...,这不可能……
"Pretty outlandish stuff, eh?\! I try not to question it, makes things nice 'n easy.",相当诡异的东西，嗯？\!我尽量不去质疑它，这样让事情就会简单明了。

"It is normal to resist your fate. I cannot force you to do anything.\! All I ask is that you put your trust in us, and all the Donari Temple, your newest ally.\! You are now known to the Followers of Zanatus...\| They will be coming for you.\! I have a small army here in Granheim Abbey. If you would join us, we are planning to return home, to our main Temple at Lemelin.",反抗宿命是很正常的。我无法强迫你做任何事。\!我只希望你信任我们以及整个多纳尔圣殿，你最新的盟友。\!扎纳图斯的追随者们已经知晓了你的存在……\|他们会为你而来。\!我在格兰海姆修道院这里有一小股部队。如果你愿意加入我们，我们正计划重返家园，回到我们位于莱梅林的主圣殿那去。
"You've saved my life.\| I owe you the benefit of the doubt.\! But only as far as your home Temple.\! Zelos could still be out there.\! He would be looking for me, so I can't just leave him behind...",你救了我的命。\|我应该相信你们。\!但我只会跟你们到主圣殿，\!泽洛斯可能还在什么地方。\!如果角色互换的话，他会试图找我的，所以我不能把他丢下……
"My friend, if you and I truly are Nephilim, I will never leave your side, and no one will stand in our way.\! It is the fate of Nephilim to reunite as one, else all may be lost.\! No friend of yours will go unsaved, no enemy of yours will go unpunished.\! Of this, you have my word and my honor.",我的朋友，如果你我真是圣灵转世，那我们将永不分离，凭谁也不行。\!重回一体是圣灵的宿命，不然的话，恐怕会万事皆休。\!你的友人将得救赎，你的敌人将遭惩戒，无有例外。\!于此，我以我的荣耀和诺言向你发誓。
Hard to argue with that...,还真是难以拒绝……
"Come, I requested that a force of Temple warriors be assembled for us.\! Let us meet them.",来吧，我已经吩咐修道院为我们集结一支圣殿武士部队。\!让我们见见他们。
