"\c[1]The Paladin and her cute little band of friends continue to elude you, my champion.\! How, with such might as yours?\! ...You wouldn't make this feeble old man do it himself, would you?",\c[1]我的英雄，圣骑士和她可爱的小伙伴们到现在依旧能躲过你。\!怎么可能呢，你明明这么强？\!……你不会让这个虚弱的老家伙自己动手吧？
Those rebels mean nothing to me.\! It is the Emperor who lives only as you allow.\! It is...\| beginning to test my loyalty to you.,那些叛军对我来说毫无意义。\!皇帝才是在你手下苟且偷生的人。\!它……\|开始考验我对你的忠诚。
"\c[1]Your loyalty to me?\! Why...\| I could not bear to see you waver!\! Please, my champion, you must understand, institutions take time to disassemble.\! If we were to send Casamir to the void now, it would undermine the legitimacy of the regime we control.\! It would undo all of the work we've done... that you've done!\! For now, we must simply tell him what to do.\! And he has proven an obedient pawn. As you can see, the Temple is all but extinct.\! The moment he becomes obsolete, his life is yours to take.\! Then, this world will finally call you Emperor.",\c[1]你对我的忠诚？\!哎呀呀……\|我可不能忍受你动摇！\!拜托了，我的英雄，你必须明白，这些机构需要时间来瓦解。\!如果我们现在就把卡萨米尔送到虚空去，我们控制的这个政权的合法性就会受到质疑。\!这将使我们所做的所有工作……你所做的所有工作付之一炬！\!目前，我们必须满足于使唤他。\!。事实也证明，他是个听话的棋子。如你所见，圣殿已经完全灭绝了。\!他被淘汰的那一刻，他的生命就是你的了。\!之后，这个世界将终于称你为皇帝。
"\c[1]For now, the Paladin has sent her forces to attack the capital from the east.\! Perhaps she has a death wish?\! Your duty, Hand of Zanatus, is to fulfill that wish!\! Once you have taken Diana's big blonde head, the rest of them will crumble.",\c[1]目前，圣骑士已经派兵从东面进攻首都。\!也许她想找死？\!扎纳图斯之手，你的职责，就是要实现她的愿望！\!。一旦你取走戴安娜的金发首级，其他人就会土崩瓦解。
