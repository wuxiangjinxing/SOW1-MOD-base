Chapter 1: Rebellion,第1章：平叛讨逆
"Good, looks like they haven't sent much out yet.",很好，看上去他们没派出多少人。
"You should take these guys out to get some battle experience.\! You can move your squad next to the enemy soldiers and attack.\! If you run into trouble, I'm right behind you.",你应该干掉这些家伙来获得一些战斗经验。\!\!你可以把你的小队移动到敌方士兵旁边并发起攻击。如果遇到什么麻烦，别忘了我就在你身后。
"Take a break, Zelos, I've got this!",泽洛斯，放轻松，包在我身上！
"We took some damage in that fighting, but we can heal it back by having Support units, such as the Medic in your squad.\! While they cannot attack, Support units help greatly to keep soldier losses to a minimum.",我们在战斗中受到了一些伤害，不过我们可以通过辅助单位（比如小队里的医疗兵）治疗回来。\!辅助单位无法攻击，但却能把单位损失降到最低。
"Next, we need to capture that town, so we can liberate it from the rebels.\! Move any Squad to the town's front gate, and ""Seize"".",接下来，我们要占领那个村子，把它从叛军的统治下解放出来。\!把任意小队移动到村子的正门，选择“攻占”。
"Good, we liberated a town, and got some Gold and Faction XP (stars) for our trouble.\! We'll need Gold for a lot of things. Recruiting new troops, hiring Mercenaries, buying Artifacts, among others.\! Faction XP allows us to increase Faction Rank.\! As Faction Rank increases, our reputation will improve among the people.\! This will yield better shop prices, discover new technology, attract new recruits, and intimidate our enemies.\! The squad who captures objectives gets Leadership (LDR) and Loyalty XP as well!",很好，我们解放了一个村子，还得到了一些金币和阵营经验（星数）。\!金币可以用来做很多事情：招募新兵、雇佣佣兵、购买装备等等。\!阵营经验能用来提升阵营等级。\!随着阵营等级的提升，我们在人群中的口碑会随之提升。\!这会带来更优惠的商店价格，有助于发现新科技，吸引新成员，并震慑我们的敌人。\!占领战略点的小队还会获得统率和忠诚度经验！
"The Imperial Army has already arrived...\| much sooner than I expected.\! Wolfgar, I'm trusting you to lead our troops here.\! If you hold the river fortress, we should be safe here.",帝国军已经到了……\|比我预想的早很多。\!沃尔夫加，我们的军队就由你指挥。\!守住河岸的堡垒，我们应该就安全了。
"I'll make them regret coming here, don't worry, General.",放心吧，将军，我会让他们后悔来到这儿的。
"Looks like we made it just in time!\! Are you ready for this, Sybil?",看上去我们来得正好！\!茜比尔，你准备好了吗？
"Are you kidding, Jules?\! I've been waiting ages for a chance to prove my mettle!\! Come and get it, rebel scum!",朱尔斯，你在开玩笑吗？\!我等这个证明自己的机会好久了！\!放马过来吧，反叛的渣滓！
"Your squad has tougher soldiers, so should stay in front.\! Mine will provide long-range archer attacks from a safe distance.",你小队的士兵装甲更厚，应该待在前线。\!我会在安全距离用弓兵提供远程火力。
"See that hill?\! That's high ground, very useful, especially for archers like me!\! Move me onto the hill so I can shoot further than normal!",看到那个小土丘了吗？\!那是高地，在战场上很实用，尤其是对我这样的弓兵。\!把我移动到那儿，这样我就能射得更远了！
"Over there, to the East.\! I think that's Jules, a fellow Imperial Academy cadet of mine.\! We should meet up with them and join all our forces together.",看，东边那头！\!我想那是朱尔斯，我之前在帝国学院的同学。\!我们应该跟他们会合，把力量集中起来。
"If we can take that river fortress, the path to the main enemy base will be clear.\! Forts give defense bonuses and allows archers to shoot farther.\! And that goes for both sides, so we can't underestimate those defenders!",如果我们能拿下河边的堡垒，前往敌方大本营的道路就畅通无阻了。\!堡垒会提供防御加成，并让弓兵的射程更远。\!这个加成对敌我双方都适用，所以我们可不能小看敌人的守卫！
We've really got them on the run now!\! The river fortress is ours. Time to take down the local rebel commander at Eastwall.,看来我们是真的把他们给打跑了！\!河岸堡垒已被我们拿下。是时候解决东墙堡垒的叛军守将了。
"Damned Imperial dogs...\| they are really this ruthless?\! The rest of you, get out there and stop them!\! Our cause will not be snuffed out here!",该死的帝国狗……\|他们就真的这么凶狠？\!还剩下的人，出去阻止他们！\!我们的大业不会在这里终结的！
"Looks like we've got another fight on our hands.\! \n[8], we're counting on you as the army leader to destroy the enemy.\! Hopefully their leaders will get the message and lay down their weapons.",看起来我们还有另一场仗要打。\!\n[8]，希望你能带领我们击垮他们的军队。\!但愿他们的军队能得知消息并放下手中的武器。
"We just can't help crossing paths, Jules!\! Looks like we're in this together, huh?!",我们总是能碰到一块儿，朱尔斯！\!咱俩似乎也都得参加这场战斗，对吧？
"\n[8]!\! What an honor to fight by your side in our first mission, but...\| Central Command didn't say you'd be here!\! Was there some sort of mistake?",\n[8]！\!能在第一轮任务里跟你并肩作战真的很荣幸，但……\|中央司令部可没提到你会在这儿！\!是出了什么岔子吗？
We...\| decided to improvise.,这……\|只是我们一时兴起。
"Anyway, glad to have your rangers here among us.\! With clever planning, your troops can pick off enemies without fear of a counter-attack... unless they have their own archers of course.",不管怎么说，很高兴能和你的弓兵们并肩作战。\!没有弓兵的敌方小队在面对无法反击我方远程攻击，只能单方面挨打……布阵时要利用好这一点。
"So you're leading this mission?\! Wow, I always knew you'd do great things, \n[8].",所以这个任务是由你带队吗？\!哇，我就知道你会有大成就的，\n[8]
"Oh, come on, Jules.\! You'd say that no matter what I end up doing.",唉，拜托，朱尔斯。\!无论我最终变成什么样的人你都会这么说的。
Well met... you're with the Imperial Army?,你好……你是帝国军的？
"Name's Sybil, battle maiden of Veridia!\! Jules and I were sent up the river to try and outflank the rebels.",我是茜比尔，维尔迪亚的战斗女官！\!朱尔斯和我被派到河的上游来包抄那些叛军。
That's an impressive title...\| but you wear the garb of a Temple priestess.,令人印象深刻的头衔……\|但你穿着圣殿女祭司的祭司服。
"Yeah, so what?\! Healing's just as important as hurting, isn't it?!",对呀，那又怎样？\!回复和输出一样重要，不是吗？！
Of course.\! We're fortunate to have a priestess among us.,那当然。\!能有一位女祭司是我们的幸运。
"See that town?\! To win wars, we must secure objectives.\! Objectives can be towns, mines, stables, or military bases.\! Towns like this, or gold mines, provide gold.\! Any of our squads can capture objectives.",看到那座村子了吗？\!为了取得胜利，我们必须夺取战略点。\!战略点包括小镇、矿井、马厩和军事要塞。\!这样的小镇以及金矿，能提供金币。\!任意一支我方小队都能占领战略点。
"There. That's Eastwall Fortress, home base of the enemy.",看这里，这是东墙要塞，敌人的大本营。
"That's a heavily-fortified castle, like most home bases.\! It provides defensive bonuses to soldiers stationed there.\! Do not underestimate any base defender...\| even these clowns.\! There will be times when we are operating out of a Home Base. When that happens, you must defend it at all costs.\! If an enemy reaches our Home Bases, it will force us into defeat.",和大部分本营一样，是个防守严密的城堡。\!\!它会为驻扎其中的士兵提供防御加成。不要对任何守城者掉以轻心……\|哪怕是这些杂鱼。\!我们也会遇到必须以大本营为支点行动的时候。在那种情况下，你必须不惜一切代价守好大本营。\!如果让敌人进入我方主城，我们就输了。
"We've secured an Iron Mine.\! With the 3 Iron we just gained, we can upgrade our troops to more advanced classes when between chapters.\! The resources are not consumed, just allocated, meaning we can change classes without any risk at all - feel free to experiment!",我们已经占领了一座铁矿井。\!加上之前得到的3块钢铁，我们就可以在章节过场时把士兵们升级到更高的职阶。\!这些资源并没有被消耗，只是被分配到了这些单位上，意味着我们可以无所顾虑地转换职阶。尽情试验和探索吧！
