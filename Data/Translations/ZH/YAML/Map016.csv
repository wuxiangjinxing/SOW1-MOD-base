Chapter 12: Upheaval,第12章：动荡不安
"My Duke, we have word that there is a massive riot in the streets of Rimorgue!\! The mob is calling for an end to war and they demand compensation!\! Our government has been exiled!",公爵，我们收到消息，里莫格街头发生了大规模骚乱！\!暴民们呼吁结束战争，而且他们还要求补偿！\!我们的政府被流放了！
What?!\! Why now?!\! Then we mustn't waste time!\! We must take Fort Eureeka without delay - overwhelm their defenses! Charge!!,什么？！\!为什么会是现在？！\!那我们就不能浪费时间了！\!我们必须立刻拿下尤里卡堡——摧毁他们的防御工事！冲啊！！
"So, it's come to this...\! Lysander, how could I have miscalculated this bad...",所以，事情到了这一步……\!莱森德，我怎么会做出如此糟糕的误判……
"Don't worry about it. Look at them, they're fools.\! Preparing to charge a position as heavily fortified as this.\! They're throwing lives away... one has to wonder why.\! As long as we control the chokepoints in the walls, Fort Eureeka will hold.",别担心。看看他们，一群蠢货而已。\!竟然准备向如此坚堡发起冲锋。\!他们正在浪费生命……我很好奇原因。\!只要我们控制着城墙的关键要道，尤里卡堡就守得住。
