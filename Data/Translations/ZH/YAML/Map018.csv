Chapter 18: Emborian Dawn,第18章：恩博尔的曙光
Diana...\| I can't tell you what a relief it is to see your face again.,戴安娜……\|再次见到你的面容，我的心里说不出有宽慰。
"I have proven a failed leader.\! Casamir is strong as ever, and almost all signs of the Temple are gone.",事实已经证明，我是一名失败的领导者。\!卡萨米尔还是一如既往的强大，而圣殿势力已经几近全灭了。
"You punish yourself far too much...\| Because of you, all hope is not lost.",你对自己太苛刻了……\|因为你还在，希望也就还在。
It is my son.\! I fear I will lose myself completely if I lose him.\! \n[8]...,我的儿子出事了。\!我害怕如果我失去他，就会完全迷失自我。\!\n[8]……
"Remember when you told me you would be my ally, and no one I cared about would be left behind?",还记得吗？你当初告诉我，你会成为我的盟友，不会抛弃任何我在乎的人。
"Your son's out there, and I'll spend my last breath to help you find him.\! You shouldn't have to bear the burden alone anymore.\! You are Diana, the greatest Paladin of all time, Nephilim Avatar of might - don't let the enemy forget that!",你的儿子还在，只要我一息尚存，就会竭尽全力为你找到他。\!你再也不必独自承担一切了。\!你是戴安娜，是有史以来最伟大的圣骑士，力之圣灵的化身——可别让你的敌人忘记这一点！
...Thank you.,……谢谢。
"I could swear, this is all just a night after far too much drink, m'friend.\! Seein' ghosts here.",我可以对天发誓，我的朋友，我是不是昨晚喝多了在发梦。\!我这是见鬼了吗。
What's even more amazing is you're still in one piece.,有什么能比你还活着这点更惊人呢。
"Sure, 'cept I didn't come crashin' down on a lightning bolt from the sky.\! What gives, anyway?",当然了，但我可没随着一道闪电刺破云层砸下来。\!话说，这到底是怎么回事？
"Didn't you feel a certain energy up on that mountain, before I arrived?",在我归来之前，你有没有从那座山上感受到一种能量？
"Yeah. Got all uh...\| tingly.\! Can't find the words for it, believe it or not.",有的。感觉……\|全身都刺刺的疼。\!很难形容，信不信由你。
"We've recreated Donar's arrival in the modern day.\! Stefan, the Nephilim Avatar of speed, skill, and guile.\! It is difficult to fathom.\! But we've got more practical problems right now, don't we?",我们在当代再现了多纳尔的降临。\!斯泰凡，速度、灵巧和诈欺的圣灵化身。\!虽然难以理解，\!但我们当下有更现实的问题得去解决，不是吗？
"Righto, \n[8].\! I've got a blade that's waitin' to send some cultists to the void, and coffers ready to be filled with mountains of Imperial plunder!",说得对，\n[8]。\!我的刀刃渴望着异教徒的鲜血，我的金库正渴望着掠夺，渴望着海量的帝国财宝！
"After a thousand years, the Nephilim Millennium War has resumed...",千年之后，圣灵千年战争再启……
"After a thousand years, the Nephilim Millennium War has resumed, and with Donar's intervention, we have new tools available to us in battle, Nephilim Battlefield Powers.\! These powers can be used at any time, and don't affect a Squad's turns.\! These powers can be used to teleport squads, render a squad invincible, drop a divine meteor on an enemy, and more.\! When my power, the power of Donar is available, let's try to use it.\! It will refresh any one of our squads' turns, allowing them a second turn within our phase of battle.",千年之后，圣灵千年战争再启，在多纳尔的支持下，我们有了新的战场工具：圣灵之力。\!这些力量可以随时使用，不会占用小队的常规回合。\!这些力量可以用来传送小队，使小队免疫伤害，召唤流星打击敌人等等。\!当我的力量——多纳尔之力可用时，试着使用它。\!这个技能会刷新任意一支己方小队的回合，使得他们可以在我方战斗阶段中行动第二次。
