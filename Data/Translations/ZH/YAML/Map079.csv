What sounds more worthy of one's time to you?",误会...是的，是的，她内心一定空虚得很呐。\!除了她不见人影的父亲之外，没有其他家庭成员，脑子被魔法搅得乱七八糟，等等等等。\!我已经接受了这些。\!我可以就这样沉浸在自怨自怜里，也可以在永无休止的混乱中寻求刺激满足自己。\!这其中有什么什么听起来值得你花时间投资的吗？
I mean um... thanks for caring.\! For some reason it is different when you say it.\! You trying to get your hands on my future piles of money?,我是说，嗯...谢谢你关心。\!出于某种原因，由你说出来总是会变成另一种味道。\!你在觊觎我即将拥有的金山银山吗？

"Oh, neat!",噢，太棒了！
So you didn't know I'm going to be filthy rich?? Then...,所以说你都不知道我会暴富的吗？？那么…
