ENGLISH,ZH-cn
Hey. I'm glad you made it.,嘿。很高兴你来了。
My King assures me that the situation in Sayunaa is stable.,我的国王向我保证萨育纳的局势是稳定的。
"Alright, that's good to hear.\| Is that...",好吧，听上去不坏。\|是不是说……
"\n[8], what is the purpose of your new mission?",\n[8]，你新任务的目的是什么？
"My role in the Millennium War is over. Zanatus is finally dead.\! I came close to losing myself completely, Narima. I can't face the people of Armitage again...\| not for a while.",我在千年战争中的使命结束了。扎纳图斯终于死了。\!我差点完全迷失了自我，娜瑞玛。我无颜面对阿米塔吉的人民……\|至少短时间内不行。
"I find your assessment of the people of this land innaccurate, \n[8]. But, I understand what it is like to keep the demons within under control.",我觉得您对这片土地上的人民有些误解，\n[8]。但，我能理解那种想要控制住自己内心恶魔的感觉。
You're probably right. But Zanatus's dying words still haunt me.,或许你是对的。可扎纳图斯临死前的话语现在还在我耳边挥之不去。
That foul deceiver is still manipulating you from the void. You must not give in.,那卑鄙的骗子现在还在无形中操纵着您，您可不能屈服。
"He may be a manipulator, but I felt no deception in those words. Zanatus's hatred for Donar, and for me, cannot be described.\! He felt a certain peace in his final moments. As though he'd finished his job.\! We have reports that some of the Followers of Zanatus went into exile, far to the East, bound for Grothnor of all places.",他或许真的喜欢玩弄人心，但我觉得那些话不是谎言。扎纳图斯对多纳尔和我恨之入骨。\!但他在临终之时，却有种难言的平静。仿佛终于完成了自己的使命一般。\!我们有报告说，一些扎纳图斯的追随者已经流亡到遥远的东方，前往名为葛索诺的土地。
"Grothnor, the most dreadful place in all Tahnra. You are certain this is the path for you?",葛索诺，这可是全塔恩拉最可怖的地方。您确定这是您的道路所向吗？
"Just an instinct for now. As you know, I have a hard time ignoring that.",目前只是一种直觉。你也知道，我很难无视这种感觉。
...Then I will enjoy slaying what ever abominations may threaten you along the way.,……那我会好好享受与您一路同行，清扫一切恶意威胁的旅途的。
"...\| You're coming with me?\| That's... the best I could possibly wish for, but what about...",……\|你要跟我一起吗？\|这是……我梦寐以求的结果，可……
"My mind is settled. My country, my homeland...\| it has meant everything to me. But it is doomed in a rapidly-changing future that will leave it behind.\! The irony is clear to me, that I spent my life to preserve tradition, and now see it as Sayunaa's greatest weakness.\! My people must embrace the outside world. And if my journey into the unknown can be a small part of that, so be it.",我意已决。我的国家，我的故土……\|这曾经就是我的一切。可在瞬息万变的将来，那些旧日的传统注定会被无情甩开。\!这可真是对最我闪亮的耳光啊，我这辈子都在维护传统，现在却将其视为萨育纳最大的弱点。\!我的人民必须拥抱外面的世界。如果我探索未知的旅程可以成为这其中的一小步，那就这样吧。
...Oh.,……噢。
"Oh, \n[8], you know that expressing those feelings is not easy for me...\| Please, just...",噢，\n[8]，你知道表达这些感受对我来说并不容易……\|拜托了，就只……
"Narima...\| it wasn't Grothnor that scared me.\| It was not being able to see your face, and for its memory to fade with time.\! As long as I'm with you, it feels like all the world's terrors can't even phase me.",娜瑞玛……\|我害怕的不是葛索诺。\|而是无法看到你的面庞，再加上这记忆也会随着时间的流逝而淡化。\!只要和你在一起，世间所有的恐怖都无法将我动摇。
"I feel the same, \n[8].",我也一样，\n[8]。
"Time to head off then, hero of Sayunaa. Let's forge that future.",是时候出发了，萨育纳的英雄。一起铸造这未来吧。
