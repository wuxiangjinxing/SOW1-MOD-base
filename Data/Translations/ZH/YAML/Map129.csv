"Hey, \n[8]! Are we leaving now?",嘿，\n[8]！你要离开了是吧？
"Hi, Sybil. Yeah, it's that time. My role in Veridia is done for now. The Nephilim War is done, and Zanatus is finally dead.\! The time will come for me to face the people of Veridia, but not for a while.\! ...Didn't you say you had to serve the Temple for a year?",嗨，茜比尔。没错，是时候了。眼下我在维尔迪亚的使命结束了。圣灵战争落幕了，扎纳图斯也终于倒下。\!我总是要回去面对维尔迪亚的子民的，但眼下不会。\!……不是说你必须为圣殿服务一年吗？
"Yeah, about that...",是的，关于那个……
Oh no. Don't tell me...\| you'll regret not doing that!,噢不，不要告诉我……\|不参加的话你会后悔的！
"No, it's fine! I uh...\| found out exactly what you've got planned. And...",不，没事的！我，呃……\|发现了你的计划。然后……
...And you told Diana all about it.,……然后你就把一切跟戴安娜都说了。
"Yeah...\| sorry! But she said this counts, and that once I come back from Grothnor, I'll be a full Paladin for life!",是的……\|对不起！但她说这也算功绩，而且只要我从葛索诺回来，就能成为一名真正的圣骑士了！
...You understand what Grothnor is?\| They say Donar's light has never touched that place.\! That Zanatus himself was born from its depths.,……你知道葛索诺是什么地方吗？\|据说那是多纳尔的光辉从未触及之地。\!扎纳图斯本体就是从那儿的深处诞生的。
"Oh, whatever, we can take it!\| So, what do you hope to find out?",噢，怎样都好，我们能行的！\|所以，你是想找到些什么？
"Zanatus's dying words still haunt me. I felt no deception in those words. Zanatus's hatred for Donar, and for me, cannot be described.\! He felt a certain peace in his final moments. As though he'd finished his job.\! We have reports that some of the Followers of Zanatus went into exile.\! My resurrection leaves more questions that need answers, and my instinct points to the east, to Grothnor.",扎纳图斯临死前的话语至今仍在我耳边挥之不去。我不觉得那是谎言。扎纳图斯对多纳尔和我恨之入骨。\!但他在临终之时，却有种难言的平静。仿佛终于完成了自己的使命一般。\!我们有报告说一些扎纳图斯的追随者已经开始流亡。\!我的复生留下了更多未解之谜，而我的直觉指向东方，指向葛索诺。
"I'm so fired up, \n[8], let's get going!\| Let's show these baddies there's nowhere they can hide!",我正觉得热血沸腾呢，\n[8]，让我们开始吧！\|让这些坏家伙们明白他们是无处可藏的！
"Heh, of course, Sybil.\| I'm truly grateful you're on my side...",呵呵，当然了，茜比尔。\|我真的很感激你在我身边……
