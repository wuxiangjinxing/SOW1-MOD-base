My king. All is well. The Dargon dynasty is restored.,我的王上。一切都在走上正轨。达贡王朝复兴了。
"I'll never get used to that...\| Especially from you, Narima.",我真是永远都习惯不了……\|尤其是你当你这么叫我的时候，娜瑞玛。
"You must embrace your heritage.\! Our people are desperate for a return to the glory of old.\! Do not worry, we of the Scions of Dargon will not leave your side.",您必须拥抱您的遗产。\!我们的人民迫切地渴望重现昔日的荣耀。\!请安心，我们达贡后裔永远会站在您身边的。
"Thanks so much...\! But please, you've done so much of the work!\! All I did was be born!\! You should still refer to me as Jules.",非常感谢……\!可拜托，绝大多数工作都是你做的！\!我就只是投了个好胎！\!你还是叫我朱尔斯好啦。
"That is another matter...\! The name 'Jules' was given to you by Veridian aristocracy.\! It is not a proper name for a Sayunaari king.\! May I suggest Kasim, the name of your great grandfather, the first descendant of Dargon who was denied the crown.",这就是另一件我需要和你讨论的事了……\!“朱尔斯”这个名字是维尔迪亚贵族为您取的。\!并不适合萨育纳的王。\!我斗胆推荐“卡西姆”，这是您曾祖父的名字，也是第一个被剥夺王位的达贡后裔。
King Kasim of Dargon...\| Well...\| Let me think about it!,达贡家族的卡西姆王……\|嗯……\|让我想想！
Have you considered acquiring a Queen to pass on your royal lineage?,您是否考虑过找一个王后来传承您的王室血脉？
"'Acquiring'? Haha, not yet...",“找一个”？哈哈，还没呢……
"I implore you to take a Sayunaari woman. A tender, pretty one.\! When we have time, you will find that Sayunaa is overflowing with them.",我恳请您选择萨育纳的女子。一个温柔、漂亮的。\!等有时间，您会发现拥有这些品质的萨育纳人俯拾皆是。
"Oh, okay.\! Well... what about you?\! You're a Sayunaari woman, are you not?",哦，好的。\!嗯……你怎么样？\!你也是萨育纳的女子，不是吗？
"My king...\| I am hardened by war. I could not provide a warm haven for you to rely upon as a man.\! Sayunaari men like you are traditional, and would be better served...",我的王上……\|我已被战争炼成了顽石。我无法为您提供一个男人可以依靠的温暖港弯。\!您这样的萨育纳人是传统的，也值得被更好地对待……
"But I'm not like them at all, I love that you're tough and determined. Like a war goddess!\! But please don't think about that. Even with all you've been through, you never lost sight of your life's work.\! I have never admired one as much as I do you...\| You are Sayunaa's greatest hero!",可我一点也不传统，我喜欢你的坚强和果决。就像战争女神一样！\!但请不要这么想。哪怕经历了这么多，你也没有忘记自己一生的使命。\!我从没有这样敬佩过一个人……\|你是萨育纳最伟大的英雄！
"You humble me...\| Jules...\| you face tremendous challenges.\! I will let you fall back into me for refuge, whenever you need. Forever and beyond, my king...",不胜惶恐^\|朱尔斯^\|你面临着艰巨的挑战。\!只要你需要，我都会向你敞开怀抱。至死不渝，我的王上……
