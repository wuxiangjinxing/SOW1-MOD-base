"Tidereavers, the mark is hiding out at Granheim Abbey, and there's a mountain of gold waitin' to reward \n[27] bounty!\! I don't care if you burn the place to ashes... I want \n[8]'s pretty little blue head.",噬浪海贼们，目标就在格兰海姆修道院，事成之后我们会获得\n[27]头上堆得像山一样高的赏金\!！我不管你们会不会把这个地方烧成灰……我只想要\n[8]的漂亮小蓝脑袋。
"Oh my stars...\| Look, a baby dragon! What a sweet thing!",我的天哪……\|看，是一只小龙！太可爱了！
"""Sweet thing...""",“可爱……”
"Yes, it's scared, too...\| What are you doing here, dear dragon??",是啊，而且它吓坏了……\|可爱的小龙，你在这里做什么？？
"Tidereavers were probably lookin' to sell it. The grown ups go for a king's ransom, y'know.\! No surprise considerin' the devastation they can bring.",噬浪海贼团可能打算要卖掉它。你要知道，成年龙的价值都够给国王付赎金了。\!考虑到它们的破坏力，我一点也不意外。
Sister Diana... please allow me to care for this dragon.,戴安娜修女……请允许我来照顾这条龙。
"Of course, Sister Abigayle. This dragon is a lucky one to have you.",当然，阿比盖尔修女。这条小龙能有你照顾，是它的福气。
Oh my stars... that's quite a love bite!\! A little softer next time? Maybe I shall call you...\| Nibbler!,我的天哪……这咬的真可爱！\!下次可以轻一点吗？你就叫……\|轻遥吧。
