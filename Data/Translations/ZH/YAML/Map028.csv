Chapter 29: Zenith of the World,第29章：世界之巅
So you chose to remain a slave.\! Pathetic...,所以你选择继续当一个奴隶，\!可悲……
Beatrix...\| My love!\| Y-you will see me again in the next life!,碧翠丝……\|我的挚爱！\|我、我们来世再会！
"""Beatrix, my love""??",“碧翠丝，我的挚爱”？？
"Oh to be him, poor, poor little Jeb, and desire that which he could never have.\! I believe we have done him a favor by sending him to the void.",噢，像他那样，可怜啊，可怜的小耶比，渴求着永远不可即之物。\!让他长眠虚空也算是帮了他一个大忙。
"Stop! This man spared my son.\! Assassin, why do you serve Zanatus?",住手！这个人放过了我的儿子。\!刺客，你为何侍奉扎纳图斯？
"...\| I am a dead man whose heart still beats.\! It is the only path left.\! But now I accept defeat, Paladin.\! My life is yours.",……\|我不过是个心脏还在跳动的死人。\!我只有这条路可走。\!但现在，我承认失败，圣骑士。\!我的命是你的了。
"The only path? You speak like you are downtrodden.\! This is what they do - they beat the hope out of you, so that they can fill your emptiness with their evil.\! But there is always hope, even for you.\! If you will turn your skills against the enemy that would throw you at a certain death.",只有这条路？这话听起来可真是万念俱灰。\!这就是他们的手段——扼杀你的希望，用邪恶来填补你的空虚。\!但希望永远都在，哪怕对你也是一样。\!如果你愿意将你的技艺转而用来反抗那些曾经把置你于绝境的敌人的话。
"You are wasting your empathy on me, Paladin.\! But if you wish for me to be an ally against the demon cult, then it shall be done.\! When they are all dead, I will disappear from your world forever.",同情我是没用的，圣骑士。\!但如果你想和我联手对抗恶魔教派，这没有问题。\!待到将他们屠戮殆尽，你我就再无瓜葛
"You will get no more fight from me, \n[8]...",我没有能力阻拦你了，\n[8]……
