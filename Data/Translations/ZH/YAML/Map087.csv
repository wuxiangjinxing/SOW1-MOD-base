I wonder if you would indulge me regarding the Donari Temple.\! The Sisterhoods of Mercy and Justice.\! You are Diana's bonded?,我想知道是否可以向你请教一下关于多纳尔圣殿的问题。\!是有关慈悲与正义修女会的。\!你是戴安娜的护道人？
"Yes I am.\! But in that regard, I am a failure.",是的。\!但从这个角度看，我是个失败者。
Why?,为什么？
A Sister of Mercy is tasked as the guardian of the Paladin's children.\! Her child remains missing...,慈悲修女有着保护圣骑士的孩子的任务。\!她的孩子现在还没找到……
Could you have prevented that tragedy?\! It would seem not.,这场悲剧是凭你之力就能避免的吗？\!好像不是。
"Thank you, but to the devoted of the Temple, it does not matter why.\! Only what happens.\! I can, however, continue to fulfill my duty to support Diana in her adventures in warfare.\! Tell me, are you a follower of Donar?",谢谢你，但对侍奉圣殿之人来说，原因不重要。\!我们只看事实。\!不过，我可以继续履行我的职责，支持戴安娜在战场上的行动。\!告诉我，你是多纳尔的追随者吗？
"I am not a devotee, though I do recognize its value.\! I lament the Donari Temple's erosion and the spread of nihilism and cult worship.",我并非信徒，但我确实认可它的价值。\!我对多纳尔圣殿的没落，还有虚无主义和邪教的蔓延感到悲哀。
"Ah, but you, the academic, probably could not bring yourself to believe in anything supernatural...",这样啊，但你，作为一名学者，可能无法让自己相信任何超自然的东西……
"Nay, I have seen that the absence of the Temple has filled the peoples' hearts with banality, making them vulnerable.\! They subconsciously desire a return to traditionalism, but what they will receive instead is the iron fist of tyranny, which will feel just the same.",并不，我已经发现了，圣殿的缺位使人们的内在满是庸碌，这让人们变得脆弱。\!他们下意识地渴望回归传统，却等来了暴政的铁拳，尽管在感觉上并无差别。

"Edelia... how do you feel about the Temple policy on... sanctioned breeding, for lack of a better term?",伊迪莉娅……你对圣殿的……神圣抚育政策有什么看法，我一时也找不到更好的词了。
"If a female acolyte is to become a devoted warrior, and purveyor of all the Temple is to the outside world, she must be of high caliber.\! The Temple considers physical ability, mental acuity, moral fortitude...\! The Sisterhood of Mercy is wedded to her faith, the Temple, to her Bonded, and most of all to her Bonded's children.\! Someone like me would never qualify for procreation.\! They wish only to allow the greatest features to pass on to the next generation of acolytes.",如果一位女侍神者想要转而成为一名专职的战士，并向外界传播圣殿的荣光，她必须在各方面都冠绝他人。\!圣殿会综合考虑身体素质、思维反应、意志操守……\!慈悲修女会的未来托付于她的信仰、也托付于圣殿、以及她的护道人，但最重要的还是她与护道人的孩子。\!像我这样的人永远没有资格抚育后代。\!他们希望只把最优秀的品质传递给下一代侍神者。
"Begging your pardon, but... someone like you? Why ever not?",对不起，但……像你这样的人？居然会没有资格？
...\| We of the Temple do not ask why.\! The traditions exist for the betterment of the world and the heavens.,……\|我们圣殿之人不问原因。\!我们坚守传统，既是为了信仰中的天国，也是为了让这个世界变得更好。
Is this why Sisters avoid associating with men?,这就是姐妹们回避与男人交往的原因吗？
"Well...\| Yes, it would distract us from more important duties...\| Men of the Temple are severely punished for tempting a Sister of Mercy...",嗯……\|是的，这会分散我们的注意力，我们有更重要的职责……\|圣殿的男子若是勾引慈悲修女，会受到严厉的惩罚……
"Ah, men of the Temple.\! And what about men who are not of the Temple?",哈，圣殿男子。\!那不属于圣殿的男子呢？
Lysander...\! Are you trying to tempt me?,莱森德……\!你是想引诱我吗？
"I wouldn't dream of it.\! But... I would like to get to know you, much more thoroughly.",我做梦也不会这么想。\!但……我想了解你，更加细致彻底地了解你。
