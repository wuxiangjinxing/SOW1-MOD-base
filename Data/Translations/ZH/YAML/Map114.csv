"Hey there, Jules.",嘿，朱尔斯。
"Oh, hi \n[8]!\! Great to see you.",哦嗨\n[8]！\!很高兴见到你。
I'm pretty relieved that you and I ended up on the same team.\! Not sure if I would have made it through the Academy without you.,我好高兴，我们终于进到了同一支队伍里。\!如果没有你，我都不知道我能不能从学院毕业。
"Yeah, I'm glad we got assigned to the same campaign, too!\! Lucky break, huh?",能被分到同一个战役里我也很高兴！\!运气真好，不是吗？
"So, what it's been like for you growing up in Veridia, as a Sayunaari?",那么，你作为萨育纳人，在维尔迪亚的成长经历如何？
"Well, I feel very fortunate.\! My adoptive parents made sure I didn't grow up without knowing about my Sayunaari heritage.\! It sounds like such a wonderous place...",嗯，我感到非常幸运。\!在我的成长过程中，我的养父母一直让我接触萨育纳传统。\!那里听起来真是个奇妙的地方……
"Yeah, shame, outsiders can't show their face there anymore without being turned away.\! They lost so much during the Succession War, and for basically nothing.",是呀，但很可惜，外人到了那儿都会吃闭门羹。\!他们在继位战争里付出了太多，到头来却基本上一无所获。
"They are protective of their way of life, so say my parents!",他们要保护自己的生活方式，我的父母是这么说的！
Maybe Veridia's leaders could learn a thing or two from that.\! I can't imagine what good is to come from the attacks on the Donari Temples.\! Most Veridians are devotees of Donar... it's as if they're trying to provoke people.\! Eh... I know you don't like this sort of thing.,或许维尔迪亚的领导者可以从中学到点什么。\!我想不到袭击多纳尔圣殿会带来什么好处。\!大部分维尔迪亚人都是多纳尔的信徒……他们就像是在试图激怒人们一样。\!呃……我知道你不喜欢聊这类事。
"It's okay. You usually go over my head with this stuff, but I like listening to it anyway.\! You're great company, \n[8]!",没关系的。你跟我说的这些东西通常都会让我头疼，但谁叫我依然喜欢听呢。\!你真是个优秀的伙伴，\n[8]！
"Haha, sometimes I don't understand your optimism, but I sure appreciate it.",哈哈，有时候我真不理解你的乐观是从哪儿来的，但我确实很感激。
