Lysander. I'm glad we finally get a chance to slow down and reflect.\! What do you think of the museum?,莱森德。很高兴我们终于有机会放慢步调，做一些思考。\!你对这博物馆有什么看法？
"I never did care for modern art.\! Splashes of color here and there.\! 9th Century is more to my liking. There is beauty and virtue in depicting the real and the true, indeed as there is vice in distorting it, as 10th Century pretenders would do well to learn.",我从不喜欢现代艺术。\!肆意挥洒的色块而已。\!第九世纪的艺术更合我喜好。对实在与真切的描绘自有其美丽与道德之处。的确，歪曲是一种罪过，第十世纪的伪艺术家们应该铭记在心。
"Ah, yeah. I can see that.",啊，确实。我能理解。
"And in regards to the beauty of our civilization itself, its architecture...\! It seems stripped away in the very same regard, making way for more... coldly utilitarian designs.\! It is as if those who drive culture today prefer to mock the pursuit of beauty, rather than embrace it.\! Why do you think that is?",而关于我们的文明本身之美，它的建筑……\!其美感看来也被以同样的方式剥夺了，让位给更加……冷漠的功利主义设计。\!就好似当今那些文化推手更倾向于鄙弃对美的追求，而不是去拥抱它。\!你认为这是为什么呢？
Veridia has subjected itself to a lot more war than for most of the last millennium.,近年来维尔迪亚战乱频仍，比过去的一千年里的大部分时期都更加动荡。
"Yes... that is a part of it.\! But at least now, I take solace knowing that there still exists two connoisseurs of proper culture in the world.",是的……这是一部分原因。\!但至少现在，让我感到宽慰的是，世界上依然还有着两个得体文化的鉴赏者。
Was it really the Succession War?,真的是继位战争导致的吗？
"In my view, there has been a creeping, grinding cultural upheaval since the Aetherium Crisis ended.\! However, I do believe that the shock to the fabric of our society wrought by the Succession War exposed the festering wound for all to see.\! So, one may very well conclude that the Succession War was solely responsible for... this feeling.\! This intuitive feeling so many of us know, but are unable to properly convey.\! That something is not quite right.\! That purpose has been stripped away from our lives.",依我之见，自以太危机结束以来，一场缓慢，难以察觉却又势不可挡的文化剧变业已诞生。\!不过我确实相信，继位战争对我们社会结构造成的冲击把溃烂的伤口暴露在了所有人眼前。\!因此人们很可能会得出这样的结论：继位战争就是让我们……产生这种感觉的罪魁祸首。\!我们很多人都在直觉上感受到了，只是无法精确地用言语表述出来。\!意即：事情有些不对劲。\!我们人生的目的被剥夺了。
...And how do we get it back?,……我们又该如何取回它呢？
"Just as it did not decay overnight, it will not be restored quickly. Perhaps, not even in our lifetimes.\! But one thing we do know is that you are now the beacon of salvation for the Donari faithful.\! Broader purpose may have to come from you, for the time being.",就像它不是在一夜之间腐烂的一样，恢复也绝非一日之功。或许，甚至我们有生之年都看不到了。\!但我们确实知道一件事：你现在是多纳尔信众的救赎明灯。\!眼下你恐怕必须承担起给他人提供目标的角色。
"You expect a lot from me, friend.",你对我期望很高，朋友。
"If not you, then who?\! That avaricious snake, Casamir?\! Men like him cannot inspire, nor truly shape the future.",不对你的话，又能对谁？\!卡萨米尔吗，那条贪婪的毒蛇？\!他那样的人无法激励民众，也无法真正地塑造未来。
I cannot do it alone.,我一个人也做不到这些。
"Continue to walk the path of righteousness, and you will always have me, and so many others, committed to your cause without reservation.",继续行走在正义的道路上，你的事业就会得到我，还有其他许多人毫无保留的拥护。
Thank you...,谢谢你……
