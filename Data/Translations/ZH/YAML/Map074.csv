Hello there. To what do I owe your visit?\! Usually I have to come to you.,你好呀。这是有何贵干啊？\!一般都是得我上门请你。
"It is difficult to achieve a connection with the others.\! I can strike and strike again with the flint, but the spark never fires.",跟其他人建立关系是难的。\!我可以尝试千百次，却永远得不到结果。
"Yeah, it happens. Guess I try and meet everyone where they are.\! So do you, you just have this ice-cold reputation to protect, or something.",是啊，有时就是这样。我猜我的做法就是尽力适应各人不同的性格。\!所以说你，你只是必须要维持这个冷冰冰的形象，还是说有啥别的？
Seems I'm no longer mysterious to you.,看来我在你面前没秘密啦。
...You are always going to be a mystery to me.,…你在我面前永远是神秘的。
"Charmed.\! \n[8], if you would indulge me for a moment...\! What have you noticed from the populations we have liberated?\! Resistance? Acquiescence?",这是入迷啦。\!\n[8]，如果你能让我放纵一会儿…\!你从被我们解放的人里看到了什么？\!反抗？认同？
"Hmmm, I have not given it enough thought.\! Ever since my return, my entire focus has been on defeating the enemy on the battlefield.\! ...This is why I have people like you around me.\! What have you observed?",嗯…我还没看出来。\!自从我回来后，我的全部注意力都放在在战场上击败敌人。\!…这就是为什么我身边有像你这样的人。\!你观察到了什么？
The purpose of this exercise is to extract your instinctual reaction.,这个练习的目的是提炼出你的本能反应。
"Fine, fine.\! They feel grateful.\! Not all of them, but I do think the ""return of Donar"" has had a great effect on the people.\! I have to perpetuate the fairy tale in order to win their support.\! But, it seems that as of now, we have it.",好吧，好吧。\!他们心存感激。\!不是所有人都这样想，但我确实觉得“多纳尔的回归”对人们产生了很大的影响。\!我必须让童话永远延续下去才能赢得他们的支持。\!但是，至少直到眼下，我们好像做到了。
"Indeed, we have liberated those who wish to be freed from the grip of those who worship Zanatus and condemn Donar.\! But, you mustn't forget. So many of them committed themselves to Zanatus on their own accord.\! From my observation, we, and the people who look to us for liberation, may well be outnumbered by those who see us as conquerers.\! The struggle will not end when we have defeated the last foe in combat,\! but when we have healed the deep wounds in the heart and soul of our people.",确实，我们已经将那些人从诋毁多纳尔的扎纳图斯信徒解放了出来。\!但是，你不能忘了。他们之中有许多人是自愿献身于扎纳图斯的。\!据我观察，我们和那些企盼着我们到来的人加起来，可能远远不及那些敌视我们的人多。\!除非我们治愈了人们内心的伤口和，清除了腐化的根源，否则哪怕我们击倒了战场上的最后一个敌人，战争也不会结束。\!
"And this is why I need you.\! Lysander, please never leave my side.\! You are my right arm, perhaps even my left.",这也是我需要你的原因。\!莱森德，求你永远不要离开我身边。\!你是我的臂膀，甚至是我的全部力量所在。
\n[8]...\| Forgive me.,\n[8]…\|原谅我。
"Oh, great.\! You're going to leave my side.\! Sorry... for what?",噢，太好了。\!你要离开我了。\!道歉…你又要道什么歉？
For never expressing to you that your...\| Your beauty is...\| Quite captivating.,我要为一直没跟你直说…\|你美得惊心动魄…\|而道歉。
"Oh... well... You are forgiven!\! A bit outside of your usual ponderings, eh?",噢…好吧…我原谅你了！\!对你来说这题好像有点超纲啊，嗯哼？
"Is it, though?\! The pursuit of beauty is a high calling.\! Without it, what we see are lifeless, soulless designs.\! Without pursuing it, why not would we then forget the value of love?\! Beauty reminds us that while our bodies occupy this world, our soul seeks to grow beyond it, into the divine.",真的是这样吗？\!追求美丽是一项崇高的使命。\!没了对美的追求，我们眼中就竟是没有生气，没有灵魂的一片死寂。\!不去追求，我们又怎会铭记爱的可贵？\!是美提醒我们，在我们的肉身居于物质世界的同时，我们的灵魂需要成长，超越，最后升华。
"...You are quite eloquent, my friend.",…你口才真好，我的朋友。
"Please, do not refer to me as your friend.\! For I cannot bear that title any longer.\! \n[8], walk with me in this life.\! Be my companion, not just my ally.",拜托了，请不要称我为你的朋友。\!我不能再忍受这个头衔了。\!\n[8]，余生请多指教。\!做我的伴侣，而不仅仅是盟友。
"Lysander...\| You need not give so much of your mind to win me over.\! If I am to walk this life with you,\| give me your heart as well.",莱森德…\|你不需要抓耳挠腮想着讨好我。\!要我和你一起走完这一生的话，\|就请把你的心也交出来吧。
"That may be difficult for me to express...\! But you must know that nothing in this life could pull my heart away from you.\! Know that I yearn for you, always.",这对我来说可能很难表达…\!但你必须明白，这辈子没有什么能把我的心从你身边挪开。\!你得明白我需要你，永远。
"Okay, I think I can do that...",好吧，我想我能做到这点…
