\c[1]Helios Lab Director's Report - 982.01.09\! Aetherite clusters stable. Energy transfer complete with negligible loss. Subject 16(B)'s life signs stable.

The Grandmaster has requested 16(B) to undergo active acclimation phase.,\c[1]赫利俄斯实验室主任报告——982.01.09\!。以太石簇稳定。能量转移完成，损耗可忽略不计。实验体16（B）的生命迹象稳定。我们认为融注结果令人满意。原型丙繁殖成功。\!圣宗要求实验体16（B）进入主动驯化阶段。
"Huzzah! The experiment was a success! Well, of course, we already knew that. But how fascinating to follow the process.\! I must ask the Grandmaster what became of this ""Helios"" project...",太棒了！实验成功了！嗯，当然，这我们已经知道了。不过，跟进这整个过程真是十分有趣。\!我得问问圣宗这个“赫利俄斯”项目后来怎么样了……
"Quiet, bird-brain. That wasn't the final journal entry.\! Look, there's one... page here with no label.",安静点，蠢货。这还不是最后的日志记录。\!看，这里有一页……没有标签。
...Oh?!,……哦？
"\c[1]I lament having to use these accursed devices. These aberrant extentions of Donar's tinge of conceit.\! The Helios director recommended exterminating Subject 16(B). The crown jewel of the considerable resources I have sacrificed.\! ""Unforeseen psychological trauma. Subject cannot be acclimated, trained, or controlled. Risk tolerance far exceeded.""\! Even my most devoted followers... still only human. Lacking entirely in the capacity to confer and convey the artistry of my covenant.\! No, 16(B) will not be exterminated. Recommend to myself - exterminate the Helios program entirely. Recommendation accepted, I believe is how they would organize this log.\! B...\| don't listen to these peons. We are going to do great things together.",\c[1]我为不得不使用这些可憎的装置感到悲哀。这些作为多纳尔的自负的延伸的异常存在。\!。赫利俄斯的主任建议消灭实验体16（B）。消灭我牺牲了大量资源才获得的皇冠上的明珠！\!“未曾预料的心理创伤。实验体无法被驯服、训练或控制。远远超过了风险承受能力。”\!。哪怕我最忠实的追随者……也只是人类而已。完全缺乏赋予和传达我的圣约的艺术性的能力。\!不，16（B）不会被消灭。向我自己建议——消灭整个赫利俄斯项目。建议接受，我相信他们是按这个格式写日志的。\!碧……\|不要听这些下人胡言乱语。我们将一起成就伟业。
M-Miss Beatrix...,碧、碧翠丝小姐……
They wanted to get rid of me.,他们想铲除我。
Surely there is some mistake!,这其中肯定有什么误会！

"Well, Jebediah, I hope this has been educational for you.\! Your Grandmaster is actually a colossal fool!",好吧，耶比底亚，我希望这趟下来你也有所收获。\!你的圣宗其实是个大傻瓜！
"N-now, you take that back! The Grandmaster's wisdom exceeds comprehension! You couldn't possibly-",好、好啦，你收回那句话！圣宗的智慧超出了人类的理解范围！你不可能……
"Couldn't I?\! Hah, you heard these little worms. ""Psychological trauma, can't be acclimated."" It was so bad, they were prepared to lose my godlike power just to avert the risk of unleashing my insanity! Ha!",我不能吗？\!哈，你听到这些小虫子的话了：“心理创伤，无法训化。” 情况是如此糟糕，他们准备放弃我神一般的力量，仅仅是为了避免我发疯暴走！哈！
Well. Subject 16(B) lives on. And all of Tahnra will feel the consequences.,好吧。实验体16（B）还活着。而整个塔恩拉都将感受到后果。
W-What are you going to do?!,你、你打算做什么？
"Oh, Jeb. You're going to have to live in excrutiating suspense for the rest of your days.\! Tell you what, you'd best hedge your bets and continue to worship me, just in case.",噢，耶比。你的余生都将不得不在对此的猜疑所带来的折磨中度过了。\!要我说，你最好两边下注，并且继续崇拜我，以防万一。
I-I have made a terrible mistake...,我、我犯下了一个可怕的错误……
