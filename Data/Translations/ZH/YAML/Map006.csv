Chapter 2: For Whose Sake?,第2章：一切为了谁？
"\n[8]?!\! What's the world comin' to, with you savin' my hide now?",\n[8]？！\!这世界真是乱了套了，轮到你来救我啦?
"It's the least I can do, Barnabas.\! I owe you the world.",救你只是最起码的事，巴纳巴斯。\!我今天所有的一切都要归功于你。
"Bah. Everything ya got, ya got through yer own sweat 'n grit.\! Wasn't my doin.'",别。你的一切都是你自己挣的，是自己的汗水和努力。\!跟我没啥关系。
"It's an honor to fight by your side, after all these years.\! Can't wait to show you what I've learned.",这么多年过去，能够和你并肩作战是我的荣幸。\!我等不及让你好好看看我这一身所学了。
"Let's plan our approach to Centurion's Rest.\! If we go to the right, looks like we're facing two squads of Cavalry.\! Cavalry are fast and powerful warriors, but fall easily to spears.\! They're guarding a stables that we can take as a source of war horses for ourselves.",我们来规划一下前往百夫长安息处的行军路线。\!如果我们走右边，应该会对上两队骑兵。\!骑兵行动迅捷、十分强大，但会被矛兵轻易击倒。\!他们守着一个马厩，我们可以拿来作为自己的战马来源。
"\n[8], look out for those walls!\! Those archers on top of the walls are protected from close-range attacks and their arrows will be much stronger.\! If we can break through and go up those ramps, we can take those guys out!\! Or, I can try to shoot at them from the ground level, but I'll be at a disadvantage.",\n[8]，当心那些城墙！\!那些城墙上的弓兵免疫近距离攻击，箭矢伤害也大大增强。\!如果我们能突破，爬上那些斜坡，就能干掉那些家伙了！\!我也可以在平地上和他们对射，但这样会吃亏。
"Or we can go left, a more direct route.\! They've got one fort there, guarded by a pretty tough squad.\! Taking that fort won't be easy.\! \n[8], the left route is connected by roads.\! Road terrain allows all units a high degree of movement range.",要么我们可以走左边，这是更直接的路线。\!他们在那儿有个小堡垒，由一个特别难搞的小队守着。\!把堡垒打下来并不容易，\!\n[8]，左边有道路联通着。\!道路能大幅提升单位的移动距离。
"Hmmm... why not both?\! More objectives to capture, more reward.",嗯……为什么不分头行进？\!占领越多战略点，收获也越多。
"Damn, are we already too late?\! Our base at Marrenburg is under attack.\! Looks like we don't have time for the rest of the army to catch up.\! We've got to save that base!",该死，我们来太晚了吗？\!我们在玛伦堡的大本营正遭到袭击。\!好像已经没时间等其他军队跟上来了。\!我们得守住那个营地！
Got it. Let's meet up with the base defender and eliminate those rebels.,明白。让我们和守军会合，消灭叛军。
"\n[8], this battlefield has a lot of Woods and Forests.\! Woods, being rough terrain slows down movement a bit, but offers some protection against long-range arrow fire.",\n[8]，这片战场有大量的树木和森林。\!树林属于崎岖地形，会拖慢移动速度，降低移动能力，但也提供了一些对远程箭矢的防护。
"So, \n[8]. The next attack dog sent by the capital.\! Do you even know why you bleed for them?\! Perhaps not... until you've been made to bleed enough.",那么，\n[8]。帝都新派来的走狗。\!你到底知不知道你为他们流血的原因？\!在吃尽苦头之前，大概是不知道的……
They've reached Centurion's Rest... fall back to the keep and prepare our final defenses.\! Donar save us...,他们已经抵达百夫长安息处……回城防守，这是最后的决战了。\!愿多纳尔保佑我们……
"See that Donari Temple, \n[8]?\! If our troops have fallen in battle, they can be revived there, for a fee.\! The enemy can do the same, so it's best we take those Temples no matter what.",\n[8]，看到那座多纳尔圣殿了吗？\!我们的军士阵亡后可以在那复活，不过需要付费。\!敌军也能做同样的事，所以我们最好尽一切所能把这些圣殿都拿下。
