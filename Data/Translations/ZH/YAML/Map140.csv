"Your suspicions were correct, Zelos. The survivors of the cult have fled to the east, bound for the unexplored continent. Looks like Grothnor is their destination.",你的怀疑是正确的，泽洛斯。幸存的邪教徒逃去了东方那片未经探索的大陆。看来他们要去葛索诺。
"...Grothnor?\| Ha, those fools have no idea what they're up against. They'd be safer here, hated as they are.",……葛索诺？\|哈，那些傻瓜根本不知道他们将要面对什么。他们在这里会更加安全，尽管在这里他们人人喊打。
"Maybe so, but that just stengthens my instincts even more.\| Zanatus's dying words still haunt me. I need answers, Zelos.\| Who actually is Donar? Why resurrect me?\| And how?\| I am even still the original me?\! And Zanatus... he had a certain calmness about him before his death. And I believe him...",或许如此，但这也进一步佐证了我的直觉。\|扎纳图斯临死前的话语至今仍在我耳边挥之不去。我需要答案，泽洛斯。\|到底谁是多纳尔？为什么要复活我？\|这又是怎么做到的？\|我还是原来的我吗？\!而扎纳图斯……他在死之前很平静。并且我相信他……
"You are right. He was a manipulator, but ironically, an honest one.\| I felt it just the same.\| Zanatus was just a small piece of a larger puzzle, one that will have dire consequences for Tahnra.",你是对的。他是个玩弄人心的家伙，但讽刺的是，他很诚实。\|我也有同感。\|扎纳图斯只是一个更大谜团的一小部分，而这个更大的谜团将给塔恩拉带来可怕的后果。
"Zelos, do you think the Veridians will ever accept us?",泽洛斯，你觉得维尔迪亚人会接纳我们吗？
I think you know. They will never accept me. But they will accept you now.\| But there's a reason you've convinced yourself that you must leave.\! I wonder if you recognize what it is... and how unnecessary it is.,你应该知道答案。他们永远也不会接纳我。但他们现在会接纳你。\|不过你说服自己必须离开想必也有原因。\!我想问你到底弄清楚这原因是什么没有……又是否明白这样纠结是多么没有必要。
"Oh, come on... back to quizzing me again?",哦，拜托……又要来考验我啦？
Yep.,没错。
"Fine.\| It's because of you.\| Obviously...\| there, I said it.",好吧。\|都是因为你。\|显然……\|没错，我就直说了。
And it is entirely unnecessary. I don't need my hand held by you.,而且这根本就没有必要。我不需要你照顾我。
"Well, you'll get it anyway, you big grump.\| Come on, I'm sure all that time spent in the belly of the beast, you learned the way to the most horrifying depths of Grothnor?",哼，我才不管你愿不愿意，你这个阴沉鬼。\|得了吧，你在那段进退维谷的日子里，肯定知道该怎么去葛索诺最可怕的深渊了吧？
"Yes. Get ready for the ride of your life, \n[8].",是的。那就准备好美妙的人生之旅吧，\n[8]。
