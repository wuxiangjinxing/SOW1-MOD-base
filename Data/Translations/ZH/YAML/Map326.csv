Narima is very confident in the Sayunaa strategy. Claims that her people wish for outside intervention.\! What do you think? Are we doing the right thing here?,娜瑞玛对我们的萨育纳战略很有信心。声称她的人民渴望外界的干预。\!你怎么看？我们现在这样做是对的吗？
"To be frank, no.",坦白的说，不是。
"Alright, then.",好吧。
"That doesn't mean it's not strategically sound.\! Indeed, it may be the only way to pull the Sayunaari away from the Imperial yoke.\! Morally, I find it an alarming shift from your former attitude toward this war.\! Perhaps, then, it is better that you are our leader, and I simply the vizier.",这并不意味着它在战略上不明智。\!事实上，这可能是让萨育纳从帝国枷锁中解脱出来的唯一方法。\!从道德层面上，我感觉你对这场战争的态度和从前相比发生了令人担忧的转变。\!有鉴于此，或许你当领袖、我做宰相的安排确实是最佳选择。
"I see...\| you baffle me sometimes.\! On one hand, when I vow to have the cultists utterly destroyed, I see only your approval.\! But now...",我明白了……\|您有时让我感到困惑。\!一方面，当我发誓要彻底摧毁邪教徒时，您是完全认可的。\!但现在……
"I just pray that the Sayunaari do not have to suffer, by our hand or by Casamir's.\! Their history is plagued with suffering.",我只是祈求萨育纳不必遭受苦难，不论是因为我们亦或是因为卡萨米尔。\!他们的历史充满了血泪与艰辛。
Then I hope they choose wisely.,那我希望他们会做出明智的选择。
