"Rest in peace, Kuroda.",安息吧，黑田。
"That makes 18 souls you've asked me to send to the void. Is your bloodlust sated yet, or do you have a 19th for me?!",这已经是你让我送进虚空的第十八个人了。你的嗜血欲是终于得到了满足，还是说你还想让我继续杀第十九个？！
"Stay your weapons, Razehl. I surely wouldn't want to cross blades with the likes of you!",放下武器，拉泽尔。我可不想和你这样的人交手！
"That man you just defeated... Kuroda, they called him. Well, little do these people know. His name was something else entirely.\! But that is no matter to you or I anymore, is it?",你刚刚击败的那个人……人们叫他黑田。呵，这些人一无所知。他其实不叫这个名字。\!但对你我来说，这已经不重要了，不是吗？
"I am in no mood for riddles. If you have business with me, out with it, old man.",我没心情猜谜。如果你有事找我就干脆点，老头子。
"I've been watching you, Razehl. I have a keen eye for true talent. And it would seem, you've proven me right.\! I've paid off these men, who have kept you as some...\| toy. Some implement of their puerile amusement.\! No, henceforth, you will be who you were made to be. The title of Kuroda... this title has spanned generations. An instrument of death. Kingmaker, and godslayer!\! That title is now yours. As so too are its many, many rewards - I'll see to that.",我观察你有段时间了，拉泽尔。我可是有双识别天才的慧眼啊。而且看来，你证明了我的判断是正确的。\!我把你从这些人的手里赎出来了。他们留着你，只是把你当成某种……\|玩具。某种为了满足他们幼稚娱乐的器械。\!不，从此以后，你将成为你生来就该成为的人。黑田这个头衔……这个头衔已经传了许多代人了。死亡的执行者。无论是王公将相还是冥冥诸神，都逃不过它的掌心！\!这个头衔现在是你的了。伴随它而来的丰厚奖励也是如此——我向你保证。
...And you expect me to do as you ask now?,……而你认为我会听从你的安排？
"You will. Not because it is my wish, but because it is yours. I know your heart, young Kuroda. Boiling, brimming with a desire for justice.\! Against the men who took your parents from you... took your future away, and any chance at peace.\! Together, we will cut them down, Kuroda. You need but trust me, little by little, as I lead you ultimately to their timely demise.",你会的。不是因为我希望如此，而是因为它是你的愿望。我了解你的内心，年轻的黑田。你在热切地渴望执行正义。\!向那些夺走你的双亲……夺走你的未来，夺走你内心宁静的人复仇。\!你我合作，我们就能将他们赶尽杀绝，黑田。你只需要相信我，我将会把你引向他们适时的死亡，在此过程中你会一点一滴积累对我的信任。
You're right.,你说的对。
Direct my blade. May the dogs calling for war never breathe again...,指引我的刀刃吧。愿那些战争贩子死无葬身之地……
"All in due time. The great lords of Ezrum, Calador, Reza, and Qurmad, and the Regent Lord of Sayunaari Palace must die.\! It is no concern of the Sayunaari people, for I have suitable replacements for all, ready to fill the void.\! Rest assured, I will see to it that they no longer act rashly, or for self-interest, but rather for the betterment of your people. Stability, and peace, at long last.",他们会的……等到时机成熟时，艾泽拉姆，卡拉多尔，瑞札，库尔玛德，以及萨育纳王室的摄政王都必须死。\!萨育纳的普通民众无需担忧，因为我已经为这些贵族选好了称职的继任者，随时准备填补权力真空。\!放心吧，我会确保这些新权贵们不再肆意妄为，或者贪图私利，而是会为你的同胞们的福祉兢兢业业。和平与稳定，终于要降临在萨育纳。
