Hey Abigayle! Are you glad to be back in Lemelin?,嘿，阿比盖尔！回到莱梅林高兴吗？
"Yes... but I must admit, I prefer the cold, and the snow, of Granheim Abbey. There is a certain magic to it that I cannot explain!",高兴……但我必须承认，我更喜欢格兰海姆修道院的严寒和皑皑白雪。它有一种我无法解释的魅力！
Interesting. Aren't you from the hottest country in Tahnra?,有意思。你不是来自塔恩拉最热的国家吗？
"I have no memory of my place of birth. To be honest, it is just another part of my life that sets me apart from most Sayunaari.\! I am a Priestess of the Sisterhood of Mercy... the Temple is my calling, and my home.\! My brother sorely wants to visit Sayunaa with me, but then again...",我对我的出生地毫无印象。老实说，这只是又一个让我的人生中与绝大多数萨育纳人不同的方面。\!我是慈悲修女会的女祭司……圣殿是我的使命，也是我的家。\!我兄弟非常想和我一起去萨育纳，但话又说回来……
...He pretty much wants to do anything and is thrilled about the idea.,……他几乎什么都想做，而且每次都很兴奋。
Ha ha ha... yes! Exactly!,哈哈哈……对！没错！
"So... you're supposed to be assigned to a Paladin, right? How's that goin'?",所以……你应该会被指派给一个圣骑士，对吧？进展如何？
"It does not happen at any given time... sometimes it does not happen at all.\! You see, the Sisterhood of Justice is far smaller in number than my holy order.\! And eligible female Paladins number even fewer.\! I do not hold the same aspiration to be Bonded as Sister Edelia is, but it must be such an honor to be Bonded with the greatest of all Paladins!\! I can only hope to fulfill my duty to serving the Temple and pursuing a life as directed by holy Donar.",我们没有确切的时间……有时则根本不会成为护道人。\!你看，正义修女会的人数远少于我的圣团。\!符合条件的女性圣骑士人数则更少。\!我不像伊迪莉娅修女那样渴望成为护道人，但能与最伟大的圣骑士建立羁绊一定是一个殊荣！\!我只能希望履行我的职责，为圣殿服务，并按照圣多纳尔的指引生活。
"Yeah.\| Wait, what about that drakeling you adopted?\! Is that in Donar's plans for you?",是啊。\|等等，你收养的那条幼龙呢？\!这也是多纳尔对你的安排吗？
Ahhh... please don't mention Nibbler to the Temple officials!\! But... I am still working on bonding with him.\! It seems it will take some time...,啊……请不要向圣殿官员提及轻遥！\!总之……我仍在努力与他联络感情。\!可能还需要点时间……
"You'll figure it out, I'm sure. Seems like the kid is a real fighter.",我相信你会搞定的。看来这个小家伙是个真正的斗士。
"I am not quite sure, but I think he insists on being by my side in this war. I do hope to see him survive, and grow to enjoy life...",也许吧，不过我相信他坚持陪伴我度过这场战争。我真希望能看到他活下来，平安长大，享受生活……
