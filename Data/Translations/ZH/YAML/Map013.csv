Chapter 8: Marooned,第8章:浪迹天涯
"Narima, you mentioned you were familiar with these lands.\! Looks pretty treacherous...",娜瑞玛，你说过你很熟悉这片地方。\!看上去危机四伏……
"The winds were not kind to us, \n[8], for this is a very inhospitable place.\! There is little room to maneuver an army through the swamp, but the land on the other side of the mountains is clear.",\n[8]，风暴给我们制造了不小的麻烦。因为它迫使我们在这个环境恶劣的地方靠岸。\!在沼泽地里，军队基本没有机动的余地，但山脉另一边是空旷的。
...\| We can't let the Tidereavers get away with their slave trade.\! We have a chance to stop them here.,……\|我们不能让噬浪团的奴隶贸易就这样进行下去。\!我们有机会在这里阻止他们。
You wish to cross through the swamp??,你要穿过沼泽吗？？
"Yes, but we will cover more ground if we split up.\! Diana, can you lead a group on East side of the mountains?",没错，而且分头行动可以覆盖到更大的区域。\!戴安娜，你能带一队人去群山的东侧吗？
"Your judgement has not failed us thus far.\! Yes, please decide who will go with me.",目前为止，您的判断一直没有让我们失望过。\!请决定谁将会和我一起去吧。
"These lands are not suited for the city-dwelling humans.\! I am called Raskuja, and for small fee of 3000 human gold coins, Raskuja will become your guide and protector.",这片土地不适合住在城里的人类。\!我叫拉斯库亚，您只需要付出微不足道的3000人类金币，拉斯库亚就会成为您的向导和护卫。
"3,000 for one mercenary?!",一个佣兵3000金币？！
"Blue-haired human has not met Barek Tor, mmm?\! We become Mercenary for many of your years.\! Pay once, and Raskuja slay all enemies of blue-haired human.\! Raskuja is deadly killer - swift as wind, strong like mountain, strike like fire.",蓝发人类没见过兽人，嗯？\!按你们的历法，我们这一族做佣兵的时间非常久了。\!只需一次支付，拉斯库亚就会干掉蓝发人类的所有敌人。\!拉斯库亚是致命杀手——迅捷如风，刚毅如山，强袭如火。
You're hired!,就是你了！
"No, thanks.",不了，谢谢。
"Sorry, friend, our finances are a little tight at the moment...",抱歉，朋友，我们的财政目前有些紧张……
"Blue-haired human is brave, perhaps foolish.\! But Raskuja like this one, he hopes enemies of blue-haired human are not to be paying Raskuja first...",蓝发人类真是勇敢，或许勇敢得有些愚蠢。\!但拉斯库亚喜欢这样的，他希望蓝发人类的敌人不要先一步把拉斯库亚给雇过去了……
"...You'd better be worth it, Raskuja.\! Please, help us out with these damn swamps.\! Blue-haired human's name is \n[8].",……你最好值这个价，拉斯库亚。\!拜托了，帮我们扫荡这片该死的沼泽。\!蓝发人类的名字是\n[8]。
"\n[8] is very smart human.\! Raskuja worth far more than few clinks of human money.\! Show Raskuja who to kill, and so he shall to be doing it.",\n[8]是非常聪明的人类。\!拉斯库亚的价值远远超过几个人类的小铜子。\!告诉拉斯库亚要杀谁，他就会照做。
Enemy reinforcements from the East... more mercenaries?!\! They seem determined to reach \n[8]'s position.\! We can cut off their advance before they reach the swamp.,东边的敌军增援……又一批佣兵？！\!他们看上去是铁了心要抵达\n[8]的位置了。\!我们可以在他们到达沼泽之前拦住他们。
