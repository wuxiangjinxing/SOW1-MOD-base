Chapter 21: Liberating Sandraka,第21章：解放桑德拉卡
We've got the Empire on the defensive.\! It seems like they are pulling out their elite forces - the local army seems pretty weak.\! Our biggest enemy here might be the weather.\! This region is notorious for flash storms coming in from the seas to the West...,帝国军现在处于守势。\!他们的精锐似乎都撤走了，城里的守军看起来相当弱。\!我们目前最大的敌人反倒可能是天气。\!在这个地方，从西面的海域袭来的雷暴是出了名的……
"Tidereavers.\! Those blokes just don't know when to quit!\! We best worry about them, friend, the last thing we want is them nippin' on our heels.\! If memory serves me right, that there's their main hideout...",是噬浪海贼团。\!这群人怎么还不老实！\!伙计，要小心他们，就怕他们黄雀在后。\!如果我没记错的话，那里就是他们的老巢……
"Their main hideout?\! We'll have to send a detachment to that Fort - destroy them all!\! The main group will push East, to the port city of Crestmoor.",他们的老巢？\!那我们得派一支分队到那座堡垒里，荡平他们！\!主战部队则向东部推进，攻击海港城市浪野。
