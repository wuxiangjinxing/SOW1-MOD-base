"Um... hello, Sister Great Paladin.\! I'm Diana. I mean, Sybil, Sybil!",呃……您好，尊敬的大圣骑士姐妹。\!我是戴安娜。我是说，茜比尔，我是茜比尔！
"Hello, Sybil. I do remember you!",你好，茜比尔。我当然记得你！
"Well, what do you think?\! I've become a war priestess for Veridia!\! That is, until Barnabas and Jules dragged me out here...",呃，你对我怎么看？\!我是说，我都已经成了维尔迪亚的战斗祭司啦！\!至少在巴纳巴斯跟朱尔斯把我拖到这里之前是这样……
That is honorable. You should be proud.,这很光荣。你应当感到骄傲。
...W-wait! Are you busy or something?,……等、等一下！你是在忙还是……？
"...\| No, I suppose not...",……\|不，我想并不忙……
"It's just that...\| I know you give the final word on all Sisterhood of Justice hopefuls, and...",只是……\|我知道你是决定正义修女会候选人是否能够入会的最终话事人，而……
"It was difficult with you, Sybil.",当初拒绝你是一个艰难的决定，茜比尔。
W-whaddya mean?,什、什么意思？
"This land needs hearts such as yours, willing to sacrifice to root out the evil that surrounds us all on fronts.",这片土地需要你这样愿意牺牲自己，来铲除环伺我们的邪恶的人。
"But in the end, the Donari Temple must remain steadfast in its ancient traditions.\! If we make sacrifices against the future, we will have lost our divine precedent for survival.\! And to that end, the Paladin leadership values a certain solemn dignity as a core tenet of our sacred order.\! One cannot want this life. One should be, in a way, reluctant to wield the power that comes with joining the Sisterhood of Justice.\! I'm very sorry, Sybil, I know it can be harsh news to bear.",但归根结底，多纳尔圣殿必须坚守古老的传统。\!倘若为了求取眼前利益而任行方便，我们就会违背圣殿赖以维生的神圣先例。\!也因如此，圣骑士团的领导将不含杂质的正直视为我们神圣教团中的核心信条。\!你不能出于渴望而加入我们。某种意义上，你应当是不情愿地使用正义修女会给你带来的权力。\!非常抱歉，茜比尔，我知道这听起来非常让人难过。
"Ugh, so I just want it too much. That's always the case.\! What am I supposed to do, just fake it or something?",呃，所以说我是太渴望它了？总是这样。\!那我要怎么做，假装自己不想要吗？
"It will come with time.\! Donar willing, your heart will find peace.\! It must... I dread the thought of growing old while bearing the burden of restlessness and regret.",时间会抚平你的内心。\!承多纳尔旨意，你一定能找到内心的安宁。\!必须这样……年事已高却依旧在不安和遗憾中煎熬是一个令我畏惧的念头。
"Yeah right, like that'll ever happen...\! Not even you notice me...",是啊是啊，说的好像真会这样似的……\!哪怕是你也没有正眼看我……
"What, pray tell has left you with such sorrow?",怎么了？请告诉我，是什么让你如此忧伤？
"You had parents, right?\! Not me.\! But who cares about Sybil when there's a million other orphans to worry about...",你有父母的，对吧？\!我没有。\!当有上百万的孤儿们需要牵挂的时候，怎么会有人特意在乎茜比尔呢……
I was indeed blessed to be around my father for much of my childhood... exceedingly harsh as he was.,我确实十分幸运能在童年的大部分时光里拥有一个父亲……尽管他严酷至极。
"Yeah, but at least you had someone to tell you if you're doing a good job or not...",哎，但至少有人能告诉你什么是好什么是歹……
"You are leading a good life, Sybil... \|but it must not come from...",你的人生走在正确的方向上，茜比尔……\|但这绝不能从……
"Yeah, I KNOW, I've heard it a million times, it can't come from someone else saying it!\! But I don't care... you can do that because you were taught to just be fine as who you are!\! And I wasn't! Just... be fine with that, okay?!",是！我，知，道！我都听了千万遍了，你绝不能从别人的口中找到自我认同！\!但我不管……你能行是因为你从小就被告知做你自己就好！\!而我没有！就……接受这样的我，行吗？！
"...Of course. Forgive my shallow words, Sybil.",……当然可以。原谅我的肤浅论调，茜比尔。
"It's just me being stupid... again...\| Just forget the last few minutes, please, Sister Diana?",是……我又在犯蠢啦……\|忘掉这最后几分钟的事儿，好吗，戴安娜姐妹？
Consider it forgotten. Donar watch over you.,就当已经忘了。愿多纳尔保佑你。
Thank you...,谢谢你……
