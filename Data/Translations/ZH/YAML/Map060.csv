Chapter 30: Armageddon,第30章：末世审判
"If only you knew how mistaken you are, Zanatus...\| But you will know soon enough.",你根本不知道自己错的有多么严重，扎纳图斯……\|但你很快就会知道了。
"Much has changed since last we did battle, Donar.\! Before the first war, humanity was united in banner and in faith.\! Now, your people are born lost and without purpose.\! Although this has made you easy to manipulate, it tempts me to put your species out of its misery, and render your kind extinct forever.",形势在我们上次战斗之后变化了很多，多纳尔。\!上次战争前，人类的信仰和国家都是统一的。\!如今，你的子民生而迷失，灵魂空虚\!这确实使你们更容易操纵，但也令我产生了将你们的种族彻底灭绝，让你们解脱的想法
"Watch out, he's winding up to swipe us with those claws... don't stand in their path!",当心！他正在蓄势准备用利爪扫击我们……远离它们的攻击路径！
"It is quite the gambit, coming here, to the Divine Realm, the bridge between what you know to be your home, and the endless darkness beyond this fragile barrier.\! I would admire such boldness if from anyone else!",走出这步险棋的你胆子倒不小，踏足神圣界域，这个连接你们所谓的家园，和被这道脆弱的屏障所隔离的无尽黑暗之间的桥梁。\!要是换了别人，我还真挺佩服这样的勇气！
"Damn, nothing can get through that shield.\! Stop those reinforcements from overwhelming us, and avoid those hot spots - he's targeting them with his magic!",见鬼，那屏障可真是密不透风。\!挡住敌方增援，别被它们压垮，也别忘了避开那些热点——他正用魔法瞄着那些地方呢！
"Everyone, we need to destroy those soldiers quickly.\! He's trying to absorb them and gain more power!",大家听好了，我们得赶紧干掉这些士兵。\!他要吸收这些士兵来获得更多力量！
"Do you know how much I pity your kind, \n[8]?\! I have watched your supposed greatest minds try to make sense of your history.\! I have seen your institutions lie to your great masses, under the guise of maintaining peace and control.\! Despite this, how little control has your kind ever had.\! Your fates are pre-determined, and history will see me as the great truthteller - the one who saved humanity from its own hubris!",你知道我有多同情你们吗，\n[8]？\!我见过你们所谓绝顶聪明的人物尝试理解你们自己的历史。\!也见过你们的各路组织，打着维护和平稳定的幌子，蒙蔽广大的子民。\!但哪怕穷尽一切手段至此，你们所能掌控的还是如此渺小。\!你们的命运早已注定，而我将作为揭示真理的伟大存在被历史所铭记——是我将人类从自命不凡的傲慢中解救出来！
"Yes. You have done enormous damage to our kind.\! It will take many generations to repair.\! Perhaps, it never will happen after so many centuries of spilling our own blood - wasted blood.",没错。你给我们造成了巨大的创伤。\!需要好几代人才能抚平。\!或许，考虑到我们已经经历了长达数个世纪的徒劳的流血纷争，这伤口永远不会愈合。
"But now, we know how to recapture our destiny. All we needed was to see and know the enemy... and it is within us.\! You and your cult have poisoned and manipulated us, but you overestimate your power.\! When you are dead, more just like you will continue to weave chaos, but our fate will once again be ours to decide.\! ...Do you feel that, Zanatus?\! I know you can.\! Surely you feel how my heart is at peace.\! Even if I die today, I've fulfilled my purpose - I've awoked my kind to who you are, and I will rest in peace knowing your grip on humanity is broken, forever.",但现在，我们知道该如何重新夺回我们的命运了。我们需要的只是发现并了解敌人……而敌人就在我们之中。\!你和你的邪教组织曾荼毒并控制了我们，但你也高估了自己的力量。\!在你死后，依然会有你这样的存在继续制造混乱，但我们的命运也会再次回到我们自己的手中。\!……你也察觉到了吧，扎纳图斯？\!我知道你能。\!你一定能感觉到我内心的平静。\!即便今天我死了，我也已经实现了我的目的——唤醒我的同胞，让他们知道你是谁。我死而无憾，因为你对人类的控制已经被永远地打破了。
"\n[8]...\|\| I imagine you foresaw this.\! In the end, I have served my purpose.\! And to a far, far greater power, I will be of use.\! And then, the races of this little realm will understand the meaning of humility...",\n[8]……\|\|我想你已经预见了这一幕。\!归根结底，我已经达到了我的目的。\!在那宏伟，至高的存在面前，我依然可堪一用。\!到那时，这小小界域里的种族就会明白什么叫做谦卑……
