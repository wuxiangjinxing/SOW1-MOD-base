"Please don't ever leave me like that again, Sybil...",请不要再这样离开我了，茜比尔……
"What am I going to do with you, Sybil...",我该拿你怎么办呢，茜比尔……
"...Thank you for looking out for me, \n[8].",……谢谢你的支援，\n[8]。
"Sybil, let me tell you about what it means to be a Paladin.\! We are not brutes, nor do we desire for ourselves.\! A Paladin has been forged in the fire of battle for most of their lives, and is punished harshly for pursuing worldly reward, or succumbing to fear.\! We must be ready to die for Donar.",茜比尔，让我告诉你成为圣骑士意味着什么。\!我们不是野兽，也没有私欲。\!圣骑士一生的大部分时间都在战火中锤炼自己，并会因追求世俗的回报或屈服于恐惧而受到严厉的惩罚。\!我们必须准备好为多纳尔而牺牲。
"Even though evil forces have nearly destroyed us, the Paladins will live on.\! Under normal circumstances, you as a female must have bore a child to a father of the Temple's choosing.\! But we are living in extraordinary times, and our sacred order needs you.",尽管邪恶势力几乎摧毁了我们，但圣骑士们将继续顽强活下去。\!正常情况下，作为女性，你必须要为圣殿选定的父亲生一个孩子。\!但现在是非常时期，神圣教团需要你。
"Yes, I understand.",是的，我明白。
"Should you become a Sister of Justice, your sole purpose will be as a divine weapon of war, and you will wield the essence of divinity as your armor and weapon.\! With this power comes the burdens we bear - discipline, sacrifice, temperence...\! Are you prepared for this, Sybil?",如果你成为正义修女会的一员，你唯一目标就是成为战争的神圣武器，并且使用神质作为你的盔甲和武器。\!有了这种力量，也就要肩负我们的职责——纪律、牺牲、节欲……\!准备好了吗，茜比尔？
"I want nothing more, ma'am...\| I am prepared to do whatever it takes!!",女士，我别无所求……\|我准备好了！！
"Psst... I think you should probably call her ""Sister"" now...",嘘……我想你现在应该叫她“修女”吧……
"Then from now on, until you depart this world, you are a Paladin.\! Serve Donar and the cause of good and justice until your last breath.\! I am honored to welcome someone as brave as you, Sister Sybil.",那么从现在开始，直至死亡，你都是一名圣骑士。\!为多纳尔和正义事业奉献一生。\!我很荣幸能欢迎像你这样勇敢的人，茜比尔姐妹。
Thank you...\| thank you so much...,谢谢……\|非常感谢……
