Chapter 4: Paradigm Shift,第4章：急转直下
"It's times like these I ask me'self what went wrong. How'd the likes of Stefan end up against these devil worshippers, runnin' the risk of bringin' harm to this beautiful face voluntarily?\! Ah well, these prisoners likely won't be savin' themselves.",每到这种情况我都想问问自己到底是得了什么大病。为什么斯泰凡这样的帅小伙儿会自愿冒着生命危险，把如此举世罕有的脸蛋往这群恶魔崇拜者的屁股上贴？\!啊好吧，这些囚犯应该是没法自救脱身的。
"These guards are no joke, but as a certified Thief™, I can take these guys out with a Stealth Attack.\! If I'm the one attackin', I'll be able to hit enemy squads from behind, no need to fuss with the heavily-armored front line guys.",这些守卫确实不简单，但作为一名经过专业认证的盗贼，我能通过潜行攻击干掉这些家伙。\!如果是我发起攻击，就能从敌方小队的背后进行打击，没必要理会前排的重甲单位。
"Someone up there likes you, friend. Let's get ya out of those chains...",上边有人喜欢你，伙计。我先把你从这些链子里捞出来……
...\| W-what's going on...,……\|发、发生了什么？
Name's Stefan. I'm workin' for the Temple.,我是斯泰凡，在给圣殿打工。
"...Thank you, Stefan...\| I'm \n[8].",……谢谢你，斯泰凡……\|我是\n[8]。
"Can ya swing a sword, \n[8]? Well I hope so, because these cultists are hot on my trail.\! We'd best find our way outta here, friend. I think I saw the exit around the corner, just northwest of here.",\n[8]，你能挥剑吗？嗯但愿如此，因为这些异教徒追得可紧了。\!咱们得快点出去，伙计。我看到拐角那儿有个出口，就在这儿的西北方。
"...Whoa. Stefan, how do you plan on getting by the blonde with the giant hammer?",……嚯。斯泰凡，你打算怎么对付那个拎着大锤的金发女人？
"Nah, that's Diana, our ticket outta here. She's my partner in crime!",别担心，那是戴安娜，我们出去就靠她了。她可是我的同伙！
"Diana, as in, the leader of the Temple Paladins? I never thought I'd see her in the flesh.\! Why in the world would such a figure be here...",戴安娜，那个圣殿骑士的领袖？我从没想过能亲眼见到她本人。\!这样的人物为什么会出现在这里……
"Let's have a meeting of the minds later, \n[8]. If I were you, I'd just do what I do and let Diana deal with these guys while I nab the loot.\! Works like a charm every time, heh heh.",咱们待会再讨论这些，\n[8]。如果我是你，我就会让戴安娜对付这些家伙，而我趁机顺些好东西。\!这就是合作的艺术，嘿嘿。
Are you one of the prisoners here?,你是这里的囚犯吗？
"Yes, I was...",是的，我是……
This is fortunate. We did not expect this. You must come with me.,真好运。我们都没指望会遇见你。你必须跟我走。
Guess I'm in no position to argue...,我应该也没有拒绝的余地吧……
"Hell's bells, guess my cover's blown!\! We gotta get movin', kid, they're bringin' in reinforcements!",我的妈，他们发现我们啦！\!咱们得快点儿，小家伙，他们的增援要来了！
"Well would ya look at that.\! We got ourselves some Treasure, ripe for the taking.\! Sure it's not part of my mission, but as a certified Thief, I would be doing a disservice to my kind to leave any Treasures behind! It's my moral duty.\! All I gotta do is walk right on top of it, and what's inside the Treasure is ours. In fact, anyone can grab it, not just me!",哎呀，看那儿。\!鲜嫩可口的宝藏，正在向我们招手。\!当然这不在我的任务之中，可对于一名经过专业认证的盗贼来说，天授宝藏而不取可是大大的不作为！这是我的职业操守。\!我要做的就是走到那宝藏上边，然后里边的东西就是我们的啦！实际上，不止是我，任何人都可以去拿！
