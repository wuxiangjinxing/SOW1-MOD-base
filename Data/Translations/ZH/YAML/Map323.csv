ENGLISH,ZH-cn
"Gotta say Jules, haven't seen this before.\! You look like someone up and ripped 'yer heart out.",咱得说啊朱尔斯，以前从没见过你这样。\!看上去就像被人把你心给掏了似的。
"...Sergeant Barnabas, are we accomplishing anything?",……巴纳巴斯军士，我们有成就什么吗？
"Whaddya mean, kiddo?",啥意思，小鬼？
"At first, when we began this struggle, there seemed to be more hope.\! There were not as many internment camps for the children... not as many Imperial patrols around every corner.\! It seems their power only grows, and ours only wanes.",起初，当我们开始这场斗争时，希望似乎还更多些。\!没有遍地都是的儿童集中营……和无孔不入的帝国巡逻军。\!看起来他们的力量只会增长，而我们的力量只会减弱。
"Listen, I ain't gonna try 'n convince you we're winnin'. But ya gotta look at it this way.\! When Diana started our merry band, Casamir didn't have full control yet, 'n now they surely do.\! 'Course it seems like they're winnin'.",听着，我不会试图让你相信我们在赢。但你得这样看。\!当初戴安娜带着我们这一小撮人开始的时候，卡萨米尔还没有完全掌控一切，但现在他们已经做到了。\!这当然看起来像是他们在走向胜利。
"Guess I got somethin' you kids need a bit more of, 'n that's patience.\! Y'know how folks hope for change for the better?\! How's that gonna happen?\! Someone's gotta make it happen. 'N even though we're just runnin' and runnin' for about a year now, somethin'll happen.\! Ya just gotta have patience.\! Maybe the bad guys lose their nerve, maybe we get another Donar from the heavens.",我猜我比你们这些小鬼头多出了一些你们正需要的东西，那就是耐心。\!你知道大家有多么希望生活变好吧？\!但怎么让这变成现实呢？\!总得有人让改变发生。尽管这过去一年来我们基本在逃命，但事情会好起来的。\!你只要给点耐心就好。\!也许坏蛋会失去勇气，也许天上会掉下来另一个多纳尔。
"Yes my friend, I struggle to find some weakness in the enemy's regime, but it seems we are in the midst of the height of their power...",是的我的朋友，我尽力在找敌方政权的弱点了，可我们似乎正处于他们统治的巅峰时期之中……
"Trust this old salt. Folks get sloppy 'n slip up sooner or later.\! And when that happens, we're still here, still tickin', ready to make 'em pay for it.\! So just by stayin' alive, that's our way of winnin'. Just gotta keep survivin' Jules.",信我这过来人没错。人总有一天会放松警惕，摔个大跟头。\!而到了那一天，我们还在这儿，活得好好的，就能让他们付出应有的代价。\!所以只要活着，这就是我们获胜的方式。只要活着就好，朱尔斯。
