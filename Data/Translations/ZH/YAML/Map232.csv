ENGLISH,ZH-cn
"Lysander, it seems like war has evolved.",莱森德，看来战争已经演化了。
You certainly know how to whet my curiosity...,你真是懂得如何激发我的好奇心……
"It's not a gentleman's game anymore.\! The Succession War, and this one, are turning all levels of society into engines of war.\! No one is spared its horror, and its draining effect.",这不再是绅士游戏了。\!继位战争和这场战争正在将整个社会卷入其中。\!没有人能免于它的恐怖和重负。
"Indeed.\! That is why we must strike decisively and achieve total victory.\! The worst possible outcome is a stalemate, just like what lead to disaster in the Succession War.\! This is why I have focused so much of my energies on the development of gunnery tactics -\! because I believe these weapons can be used to terrify any enemy into submission, before clueless politicians get the idea to send waves of young men to their deaths.",的确如此。\!这就是我们必须果断出击并取得全面胜利的原因。\!最糟糕的结果是陷入僵局，就是它导致了继位战争中的灾难。\!这也是为何我将如此之多的精力投入到重炮战术的发展上——\!因为我相信这些武器可以在愚蠢的政客们想到让一波又一波的年轻人送死之前，就吓得敌人投降。
"I see what you mean...\| logically speaking, if one could equip an entire army with guns, it would render everything else useless.",我明白您的意思……\|从逻辑上讲，如果可以为整支军队配备枪炮，那么所有其它的武器装备都将变得毫无用处。
"Perhaps...\| But for the time being, it is rather fortunate that the pyrocite needed to make them is so limited.\! Until such time as we somehow develop a defense against gunnery, the force that controls the pyrocite will always have the edge.",也许吧……\|但就目前而言，制造它们所需的火石数量非常有限还是件幸运的事。\!在我们想出应对炮击的防御方法之前，控制火石的势力将一直占据优势。
"Seems the only good defense against firearms is avoiding their shots, and striking quickly and decisively before they have a chance to fire back.",似乎唯一好的防御方法就是避开他们的射击，并在他们有机会还击之前先发制人。
"Very good thinking, \n[8].\! You can wait for weather to change, as firearms are useless in the rain.\! Of course, you can produce similar firepower with mature battlemages or dragons, but those will be much more expensive and difficult to acquire.",非常好的想法，\n[8]。\!您也可以等到变天之后进攻，因为枪支在雨中毫无用处。\!当然，您也可以让成熟的战斗法师或龙类制造类似的火力，但他们的花费和获取难度要大的多。
