"Oh, look. It seems someone forgot to clean up the scum here.\! Pah, what happened to service?!",噢，看哪。好像有人忘了清理这里的渣滓哎。\!切，服务怎么这么差了？！

"Feeling beat up already, mmm? That just makes me want to crush your spirit even more.",已经感觉精疲力尽啦，嗯？那只会让我更想碾碎你的意志。
"You may be disappointed, Beatrix. I am quite at peace.\! One should follow their convictions, even in the face of certain defeat, lest they fall into crushing obscurity.",你也许要失望了，碧翠丝。我平静得很。\!一个人应当遵循他的理念，哪怕是在面临注定的败局的时候也是如此，以免被浑噩所击倒。
Blah blah blah...\| Peace?! You would be in pieces if \n[8] was not around to protect you from me!,啰里啰唆这一堆废话……\|平静？！如果不是\n[8]在旁边拦着，我早把你烧成灰烬了！
"Yes, of that I'm sure. And for that, I am grateful.\! One should never hope to find themselves on your bad side.\! Well... if there ever were to be a modicum of rhyme or reason to your...\| child-like whimsy.",是啊，我相信没错。为此我也非常感激。\!所有人都想尽量避免你的雷区。\!嗯……前提是你那……\|幼稚的胡思乱想中有些许可以判明的规律或逻辑的话。
"What the...?!\! What child-like whimsy?! I assure you, my victims are ordained by Donar! Do you see? Donar's power crackles from my fingertips. My divine precident is unquestionable!\! Take that back, little man!",什……？！\!什么幼稚的胡思乱想？！我跟你保证，被我杀掉的人都是多纳尔判过有罪的！看到了吗？多纳尔的力量在我的指尖噼啪作响。我作为神圣的预言之子可是不容置疑的！\!收回那句话，小家伙！
Heh heh...\| So you've become an acolyte of the Temple now?\| There's that child-like whimsy on full display.\! You really are hopeless.,呵呵……\|你现在又成了圣殿的侍僧了？\|幼稚的胡思乱想这回可真是展现得淋漓尽致啊。\!你真是没救了。
"My my, Lysander...\| what happened? Did you become a big boy overnight? I must say, this new-found persona of yours...\| impresses me.",哎呦喂，莱森德……\|发生了什么事？你这是一夜之间变成大男孩了？我必须得说，你这全新的人格……\|让我印象深刻。
"Oh, wonderful.",哦，太棒了。
"I wonder how long you can sustain it?\| You know, I heard all about your pathetic, whimpering confession to our gigantic friend.\| You poor thing...",我好奇你能坚持多久？\|你知道吗，你向我们那位硕大的朋友那可悲而带着呜咽的表白我可都听说了。\|你这可怜的家伙……
...What?\| How did you...,……什么？\|你是怎么……
"Awww, tsk tsk. Did the big lady break your heart?",噢，啧啧。那位硕大的女士伤了你的心吗？
"If you really must know, yes.",如果你真想知道答案的话，是的。
...Sigh...\| Lysander...,……唉……\|莱森德……
"Why?\| Can you see past her freckled face, to the nauseatingly... stolid persona that lies beneath?!\! A mind like yours would be bored to tears!",为什么啊？\|你就看不到她那长满雀斑的脸下面，那副令人作呕的……迟钝的人格吗？！\!像你这样的头脑会被她无聊死的！
"Beatrix, do you know why I'm still here?\| Why I haven't walked off despite your blatant attempts to infuriate me?",碧翠丝，你知道我为什么还在这里吗？\|哪怕你那么明显地试图激怒我，我却依然不走？
"Well, yes! I am shockingly beautiful, what more reason does a red-blooded man need?",嗯，那当然了！我那么美，对热血上头的男人来说还不够吗？

"And now, even after what can only appear to you as a betrayal, you remain steadfast.\| Not only in your pledge to fight the great enemy, but also to maintain your irreverent persona.\! All in a mostly vain attempt to conceal what I can only conclude is, as they say, a big, beating heart.\! I just wonder...\| when is your confession coming?",现在看来，哪怕在你经历过背叛后，你也没有背弃光明。\|不仅是与大敌战斗到底，还是维持这副目空一切的人设。\!我所能得出的结论就是，这全都是在徒劳地掩饰一颗热切的内心。\!我只想知道……\|你打算什么时候表白？
Wha...\| my confession?!,什……\|我要表白？！
"You can only try to bully me so long before it becomes obvious.\! I have concluded that either you really do want to incinerate me to ashes, or you crave me around for your continued amusement.\! I must ask, please don't keep me in suspense... as I may be even more easily bored than you.\! What's it going to be, Beatrix?",你欺负我这么久，实际意图已经昭然若揭。\!我的结论是，要么你是真的想把我烧成灰烬，要么是你渴望我陪在你身边继续供你消遣。\!我必须问出来，别再给我悬念……因为我可能比你更容易感到无聊。\!你打算如何呢，碧翠丝？
"You...\| slick, sly little devil.\| It really did just dawn on me.\! You may have declared war on literal demigods, but... you did just that.\! Men twice your strength wouldn't have dreamed of making such a brash and impudent move...",你这……\|机灵、狡猾的小恶魔。\|我刚刚才意识到。\!你可是已经向半神宣战了啊，但……你就是这样做了。\!哪怕比你强壮两倍的人都做不出这么狂傲鲁莽的举动来……
"...So was that the confession, or... shall I be on my way?",……所以这算是告白吗，还是说……我该走了？
"Stop right there, Lysander!\| Fine, you've become truly tantalizing bait. And... sure, I'll bite.\! ...I promise.",给我站那儿，莱森德！\|好吧，你这条饵儿实在是香甜得抗拒不了啦。而……当然啦，我会咬钩的。\!……我保证。
Wha...\| really?!\| I mean...,什……\|真的吗？！\|我的意思是……
"Shhh... stay interesting, I command it!\| No backing out now, little man!",嘘……我命令你，就这样有趣下去吧！\|现在可没有后悔药啦，小男生！
By Donar... what have I done...,多纳尔在上……我都做了些什么啊……
