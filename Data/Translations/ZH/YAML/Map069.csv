"So... that's it?\! I'm back from the dead, you're back from the dead, things have happened, and you're not going to speak with me about it?",所以…就这些吗？\!我死而复生，你也又活了过来，事情都发生了，你还不跟我说说清楚吗？
"Gods above, what have they done to you...\! Zelos...",神明在上，他们都对你做了些什么…\!泽洛斯…
"Everything has happened on my terms, \n[8].\! I do not need nor deserve sympathy.",一切都是我自己的意志，\n[8]。\!我不需要也不值得被同情。
That's not true!\! My Zelos would never have gone down this path...,不是这样的！\!我的泽洛斯才不会去走这种路…
There is so much you do not know.\! You'd best forget about it...,你不知道的东西太多了。\!把之前那些都忘了吧…
"Forget?!\! Stop shutting yourself off to me, Zelos!\! You know what I will never forget?!\! You, cutting Casamir's men down, one by one, in a rage because you watched me fall to their arrows.\! I won't forget you, who through all his bravado and ambition, never failed to save me when I needed saving.\! Forget?\! Go to hell, Zelos!!",忘了？！\!少跟我扭扭捏捏藏着掖着了，泽洛斯！\!你知道我永远都不会忘记的是什么吗？！\!是你，在看到我被箭矢放倒之后像疯了一样，一个接一个地带走卡萨米尔的手下。\!我忘不掉你，那么勇敢，豪迈，我最需要帮助的时候每每都是你。\!然后你让我都忘了？\!忘你个鬼，泽洛斯！！
"Heh, don't worry about that.\! I'm well on my way.",好啦，别担心我啦。\!我现在这样也正好着呢。
"You are...\| actually gone.\! I've waited so long, prayed, cried my eyes raw...\! And now you're just an empty body... like you died long ago...\! Curse this...",你已经…\|真的不在了啊。\!我那么等，那么祈求，哭都快哭瞎了…\!就换来这样一个空壳子…那跟你早死了又有什么区别…\!可恶…
"Crying...\! Do you know how many I have cut down, through their tears?\! It does not affect me anymore.",哭…\!你知道我斩了多少人，看过多少将死之人的眼泪吗？\!我早就对这个脱敏了。
"I get it, you big brute. You're numb to suffering.\! Please, just disappear, Zelos.\! I was always the one person who you would give a break, when you could forsake everyone else.\! But now you've forsaken me.\! I cannot bear the sight of you one moment longer!",知道了，你这畜生。你对痛苦的感受已经麻木了。\!求你，消失吧，泽洛斯。\!之前你就算是抛弃全世界也不会抛弃我，\!现在你总算把我给甩开了。\!我一刻也不想再看到你了！
...Is that what you want?,…这就是你想要的吗？
...I want my Zelos back.,…我想要我的泽洛斯回来。
"That's all I've ever wanted, since that day.\! Everything else has been distractions.\! Just... want... my... Zelos back....\! Give him back...",自从那天起，这就是我唯一的念头。\!其他都是杂事。\!我只是…想要…我的…泽洛斯回来…\!把他还给我…
"It's because of you, \n[8].",都是因为你，\n[8]。
...What?,…啊？
"I watched you die.\! I watched you fall from the top of the Imperial Palace.\! Executed for being a heretic.\! So, I killed them. All of them.\! They are the reason you died that day.\! And now they're all dead.\! You're a fool for feeling this way.",我亲眼看着你死了。\!从皇宫之上坠落。\!被当作异教徒处决。\!所以，我杀了他们。一个不留。\!那天是他们杀了你。\!然后他们现在都死透了。\!你要是还觉得难受，那可真是个傻瓜。
...I'm not a fool.\! Shut up.,…我可不傻。\!闭嘴。
I...\| love you.\! That's what it is.\! I love you more than can be described.\! Don't... let me just stand here like this.\! Don't let me shiver and shake without the embrace of my Zelos.\! Not another moment...,我…\|爱你。\!就是这样。\!我爱你，说不出的爱你。\!别…别让我就这样在这杵着。\!我要我的泽洛斯，我不要一个人在这儿发抖…\!一刻也不要…
"...\! Come here, \n[8]...",…\!过来吧，\n[8]…
"For you, I'm not gone...",为了你，我还保持着自我…
"But I am not the same.\! The blood on my hands will ever dry.\! There is no going back.\! You...\| You've captured the hearts of the people.\! You would be dragged down into the pits of hell if it went back to the way things were before.\! I'm still going to save you when you need saving, \n[8].\! You need saved from me.",但我也回不到从前了。\!我手上粘过的血永远也抹不掉。\!已经没有回头的路了。\!你…\|你已经成为众望所归。\!如果一切回到从前那样，名为期盼的锁链会把你拖进地狱深渊。\!需要的时候，我依然会把你给拽出来，\n[8]。\!而你也需要从对我的执念中解脱出来。
"Stop it!\! I love you and I'm not letting you go!!\! Fine, let's go be in hell together.\! I'm not letting you go, no matter what.",别说了！\!我爱你，我不放你走！！\!行吧，那一起下地狱好啦。\!我不会放你走的，怎样都好。
It's... going to be okay.\! It's just the two of us.\! The rest of the world doesn't matter.\! We're...\| going to be fine...,这一切…会好起来的。\!反正就我俩。\!跟世界没关系\!我们…\|不会有事的…
