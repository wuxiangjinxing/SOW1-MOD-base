Chapter 3: Crimson Star,第3章：猩红之星
Zelos...\| we've got to reach Antares's base before the Imperial Army.,泽洛斯……\|我们要赶在帝国军队之前到达安塔瑞斯的大本营。
"...Why? You want mercy for the defeated, don't you?",……为什么？你不想杀死他们，对吧？
"Your tale about the Crimson Star's got me on edge.\! I just have a gut feeling.\! Come on, you've used that excuse dozens of times with me.",你那关于猩红之星的传说让我有些紧张。\!我只是有种预感。\!拜托，你自己不知多少次用这个借口劝过我了。
"True, \n[8]. Maybe we can convince them to lay down their arms.",确实，\n[8]。也许我们可以说服他们放下武器。
"True, \n[8].\! Very well, I think it's time to consider the ""Force Surrender"" attack.\! Instead of destroying the enemy outright, we can force a demoralized Squad to surrender.\! Surrender still removes the squad from the battlefield, but it allows us to ransom Prisoners of War for more funds.\! Try to force the Surrender of one of these enemies while they are weakened - I see a very frightened squad in my range right now.",没错，\n[8]。\!很好，我觉得是时候考虑使用“强迫投降”了。\!我们可以迫使士气低落的敌军投降，而不是彻底剿灭敌军。\!投降一样会将小队从战场上移除，但我们可以通过让对方赎回战俘来获得更多资金。\!在敌人处于弱势时，试着劝降他们——我已经在视野范围内看到一队瑟瑟发抖的敌人了。
Now let's show Casamir's army who's the real elite vanguard of Veridia.,现在，让卡萨米尔的手下看看，谁才是维尔迪亚真正的精锐前锋。
"\n[8], as we've seen, Weather is a factor in this war.\! Weather can sometimes present new obstacles to everyone on the battlefield.\! Storms make firearms ineffective and make Lightning Mages more powerful, Blizzards slow down movement and make Ice Mages more powerful, and more.",\n[8]，正如我们所见，天气是左右战场的要素。\!天气有时会给战场上的所有人增添阻碍。\!暴风雨会弱化火器威力并让雷电法师们变得更强，暴雪在削弱移动能力的同时也加大了冰霜法师的实力，等等。
"\n[8], see that tent? That's a Bazaar.\! While our Home Base allows us to purchase equipment or hire mercenaries, the Bazaar does the same but will have higher-quality, rarer choices.\! We should try to reach Bazaars whenever we can - there might be a very lucky find waiting for us.",\n[8]，看到那帐篷了吗？那是一个集市。\!虽然我们能在大本营购买各种器材或征募雇佣兵，但集市里会有质量更高、更加稀有的选择。\!我们应当尽可能地造访集市——或许就会有意外之喜在等着我们。
