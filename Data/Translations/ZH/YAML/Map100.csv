Chapter 9: Sanctuary,第9章：避难之所
"The enemy lies before us at Lemelin Monastery!\! We shall crush the treasonous Temple for harboring the enemies of the Empire of Veridia.\! General Lysander, don't disappoint me.",敌军列阵于莱梅林修道院，就在我们前方！\!我们将击垮这悖逆之所，因为它包庇着维尔迪亚帝国的敌人。\!莱森德将军，不要让我失望。
"Yes, your excellency.\! You can count on me.",遵命，大人。\!尽管放心吧。
The Imperial government is invading the Monastery?!\! Unforgivable!,帝国政府要侵入修道院？！\!不可饶恕！
"Great Paladin...\| perhaps the government means us no harm!\! Please practice restraint, warriors...",大圣骑士…\|也许帝国没有伤害我们的意思！\!请保持克制，勇士们…
"The Prime Minister has been desperate for an excuse to destroy us, and now we've given him one.",首相一直在拼命找借口来击垮我们，现在我们给了他一个借口。
Sorry...\| I will take my leave now.,抱歉…\|我现在得走了。
"That excuse is me, isn't it, Diana...",那个借口是我，不是吗，戴安娜…
"This turn of events was inevitable.\! We are much more powerful with your tactical mind, so Donar has given us a blessing.",事情发生这种转变是无法避免的。\!有了你的战术头脑，我们变得更强了，所以多纳尔已经给予了我们祝福。
"At least we know what we're up against.\! No more mercenaries, this is the Empire's central army.\! They'll have larger and more organized ranks, and probably some gun units in the mix.\! We don't want to be on the wrong side of gunnery soldiers, their weapons make any armor basically useless.",至少我们知道我们将要面对的是什么。\!不再是雇佣兵了，这次是帝国的中央军队。\!他们将拥有更加强大、组织更完善的队伍，可能还会混编有一些火器部队。\!没人会想被火器部队直射，任何盔甲在他们的武器面前都不堪一击。
"\n[8], the Temple maintains outposts by the river.\! We should fortify the river to protect the Monastery from needless violence.",\n[8]，圣殿在河边设有哨站。\!我们应该沿河拒守，保护修道院不受暴力侵害。
"Those forts are closer to Casamir's army than they are to us, but it might be worth a shot!\! I guess now'd be a good time to pray to Donar...",比起我们，那些堡垒离卡萨米尔的军队更近，但也许值得一试！\!我想现在是向多纳尔祈祷的好时候……
"This is it, men of Isanter!\! Our chance to stand up to the central government's tyranny is now!\! We cannot abide this disgraceful action by the Prime Minister.\! Attack the Imperial Army and reinforce the Temple!!",这一天终于到了，伊桑特的儿郎们！\!我们反抗中央政府暴政的机会来了！\!首相这种可耻的暴行绝不能被容忍。\!攻击帝国军，守护圣殿！！
Isanter has arrived?!,伊桑特军来了？！
"You know what to do, men!\! The Temple will not fall today!\! We join Isanter and resolve to bring the Prime Minister to heel!",兵士们，你们知道该怎么做！\!今日圣殿必将屹立不倒！\!我们和伊桑特一道，让首相大败而归吧！
What's this?,这是怎么回事？
"That's Duke Lothair's army, and General Lysander has defected!\! Damn, good timing, fella.",那是洛泰尔公爵的军队，而且莱森德将军也已经易帜了！\!见鬼，还真是时候啊，伙计们。
Donar has answered our call - the Temple shall never perish.,多纳尔回应了我们的呼唤——圣殿永不灭亡。
What treachery...\| the Duke of Isanter must be a fool of the highest order to make an enemy of me!,背信弃义的狗……\|伊桑特公爵一定是愚蠢透顶，竟敢与我为敌！
